    "response": "Ghost, the Swedish heavy metal band, has undergone several lineup changes, including those of their lead singers. Papa Emeritus II and III are two different personas used by the band's lead singer, Tobias Forge, during different album cycles. Papa Emeritus II was the character during the \"Papa Emeritus\" era, which began with the album \"Prequelle\" in 2018. Papa Emeritus III took over with the release of \"Hexenzuber\" in 2020. To determine the age difference between Papa Emeritus II and III, we need to consider the approximate ages of Tobias Forge when each character was introduced.\n\nAs of 2023, Tobias Forge is approximately 36 years old. Given that \"Prequelle\" was released in 2018, when Forge was around 28 years old, and \"Hexenzuber\" was released in 2020, when he was about 30 years old, we can estimate the age difference between the two personas:\n\nAge difference = 36 (current age) - 30 (age in 2020) = 6 years.\n\nTo convert this into months:\n\n6 years * 12 months/year = 72 months.\n\nThe answer is: 72",
