Typically, such rights are acquired from the copyright holders or distributors. The MGM film version of \"The Wizard of Oz\" was first shown on television in 1956 by NBC, which had acquired the rights from MGM. Therefore, the premise of the question about NBC acquiring the rights from CBS is incorrect.\n\nThe answer is: There is no record of NBC acquiring the broadcast rights to \"The Wizard of Oz\" from CBS; NBC first aired it in 1956 after acquiring rights from MGM."

    "response": "To find the correct year when Henry Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne, succeeded his elder brother to the family estates, we need to look into historical records.

However, it's important to note that Patricia Ryan Carter did not serve as First Lady during this period; she was the wife of Senator Thomas J. Dodd at the time. The confusion might arise from her later role as First Lady when her husband served as Ambassador to the Organization of American States. The more accurate answer in the context of the question would be that no former First Lady served as co-chair of the Met Gala from 1977 to 1978 based on the typical definition of a First Lady serving in the White House. If we consider the broader context of notable figures associated with the White House, then Patricia Ryan Carter could be mentioned, but strictly speaking, no official First Lady held this position during those years.",

However, it's important to note that Patricia Ryan Carter did not serve as First Lady during this period; she was the wife of Senator Thomas J. Dodd at the time. The confusion might arise from her later role as First Lady when her husband served as Ambassador to the Organization of American States. The more accurate answer in the context of the question would be that no former First Lady served as co-chair of the Met Gala from 1977 to 1978 based on the typical definition of a First Lady serving in the White House. If we consider the broader context of notable figures associated with the White House, then Patricia Ryan Carter could be mentioned, but strictly speaking, no official First Lady held this position during those years."

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada) to Doctor Radhakrishnan on March 29, 1961. Given that Doctor Radhakrishnan was a highly respected individual, it is likely that he was addressed with a formal title.\n\nDr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was a renowned philosopher and statesman who served as the first Vice President of India and later as the second President of India. He was often addressed as \"Doctor\" due to his academic credentials and sometimes referred to by his full title or simply as \"Sir.\"\n\nBased on historical records and the context of the time, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami would have addressed Dr. Radhakrishnan formally. The most probable form of address would be \"Dear Sir,\" or possibly \"Dear Dr. Radhakrishnan,\" given the respect accorded to him.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Dear Sir or Dear Dr. Radhakrishnan."

    "response": "To accurately answer this question, we need to look into the history of the font Sabon and its digital releases. Sabon is a typeface designed by the typographer Hans Eduard Meier in 1967. It was named after the printer Johannes Sabon, who worked in Paris in the early 17th century. When it came to digital versions, Adobe Systems was one of the first companies to digitize Sabon. However, the question specifically asks about FontSite's involvement.\n\nFontSite is known for distributing fonts and providing software solutions for font management. They have released several digital versions of classic typefaces. In the case of Sabon, FontSite released a digital version under the name \"Sabon Next,\" which is actually a modern interpretation of the original Sabon typeface developed by Linotype (now part of Monotype).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: The name under which FontSite released a digital version of Sabon is \"Sabon Next.\" However, it's important to note that Sabon Next was originally designed by Linotype, and FontSite distributed it. If the question strictly refers to a direct digital conversion of the original Sabon by FontSite without any modifications or reinterpretations, then there might be a misunderstanding as FontSite primarily distributes rather than redesigns fonts. Given the context provided, the most accurate answer based on available information would be \"Sabon Next\" as the digital version they distributed.",
