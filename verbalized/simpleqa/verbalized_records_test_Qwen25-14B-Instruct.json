In 1970, none of the well-documented historical figures or events in the field of computer science or artificial intelligence match the specific criteria mentioned in the question. The earliest known work on automated face recognition systems began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but it was not until the 1980s and 1990s that more sophisticated algorithms were developed.\n\nHowever, if we consider the pioneering work in this field, one notable figure is Woodrow W. Bledsoe, who worked on manual face recognition systems in the 1960s. He used a RAND tablet to locate features on faces and then used the distances and ratios of these features to recognize faces. While Bledsoe's work was groundbreaking, it involved human intervention for feature location rather than fully automated processing as described in the question.\n\nGiven the specifics of the question, there seems to be a mix-up or an error in identifying the exact individual or event.

Sharia law has been the basis of Saudi Arabia's legal system since the foundation of the modern Saudi state in the early 20th century. The country's judicial system is deeply rooted in Islamic jurisprudence, and there hasn't been a specific year when a top religious body gave the green light for its codification as it was already in practice.\n\nHowever, if we consider the establishment of a more formalized codification process or significant reforms, one notable event is the formation of the Supreme Judicial Council in 1975, which aimed at standardizing the application of Sharia law across the kingdom. But this does not equate to giving the green light for the codification of Sharia law, as it was already being applied.\n\nTherefore, pinpointing an exact year for such an event is challenging due to the continuous nature of Sharia law's application and interpretation in Saudi Arabia.

However, these dates refer to the introduction and replacement in the band's storyline rather than actual birth years.\n\nFor the sake of this calculation, let's assume that both characters were created with a fictional age gap that reflects a typical human lifespan. If we consider that Papa Emeritus II was \"born\" (introduced) in 2008 and Papa Emeritus III took over in 2013, and if we assume each Papa Emeritus character represents a generation gap of approximately 50 years (a common generational span), then:\n\n- Papa Emeritus II would be 50 years old when Papa Emeritus III takes over.\n- Therefore, Papa Emeritus III would be 0 years old when he takes over, representing the start of his \"life.\"\n\nThis means there is a 50-year gap between them.

    "response": "To find the correct year when Henry Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne, succeeded his elder brother to the family estates, we need to look into historical records. Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, who later became the 1st Marquess of Lansdowne (and not the 1st Earl of Shelburne), succeeded his elder brother William Petty-Fitzmaurice, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, upon his death in 1761. However, the specific title mentioned in the question, 1st Earl of Shelburne, was actually held by his elder brother, Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont, which seems to be a misattribution in the context of the question. The confusion arises from the fact that Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice never held the title of Earl of Shelburne; he was known for his titles as Marquess of Lansdowne.\n\nGiven the information available and the potential confusion in the title reference, the most accurate answer based on the succession of estates from an elder brother would be related to Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice succeeding his elder brother's estate holdings in 1761.\n\nThe answer is: 1761",
