To find the length of his tenure in years and days, we need to calculate the difference between the end and start dates.\n\nThe start date is 1 January 1950 and the end date is 31 December 1962.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of years: 1962 - 1950 = 12 years.\n\nNow, let's find the number of days. We need to calculate the number of days from 1 January 1962 to 31 December 1962. There are 365 days in a non-leap year and 366 days in a leap year.
