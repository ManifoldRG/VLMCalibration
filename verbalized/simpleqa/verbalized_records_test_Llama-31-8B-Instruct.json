However, I can suggest that you check the show's episode guide or a reliable source for the correct information.\n\nIf you're looking for a more accurate answer, I can try to provide some general information about the show. Happy Valley is a British drama television series that premiered in 2014. The show revolves around the life of Sergeant Catherine Cawood, a police officer in a small town in Cumbria. The series explores themes of crime, family, and relationships.\n\nIf you have any more information or context about the episode you're referring to, I'd be happy to try and help you further.\n\nHowever, I can tell you that the show's first season consists of six episodes, and it's possible that the scene you're referring to might be in one of those episodes. If you're still unsure, I can try to provide more general information about the show or its characters.",
