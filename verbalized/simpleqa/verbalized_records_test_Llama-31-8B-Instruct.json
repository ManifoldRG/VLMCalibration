Each Papa Emeritus represents a different era of the band's history. \n\nPapa Emeritus II was the second persona, introduced in 2013, and Papa Emeritus III was the third persona, introduced in 2015.\n\nSince I don't have any information about their actual ages, I'll assume that you're asking about the time difference between their introduction. \n\nPapa Emeritus II was introduced in 2013, and Papa Emeritus III was introduced in 2015. \n\nThe time difference between 2013 and 2015 is 2 years. \n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so the age difference between Papa Emeritus II and III in months would be 2 * 12 = 24 months.\n\nThe answer is: 24",

Each Papa Emeritus represents a different era of the band's history. \n\nPapa Emeritus II was the second persona, introduced in 2013, and Papa Emeritus III was the third persona, introduced in 2015.\n\nSince I don't have any information about their actual ages, I'll assume that you're asking about the time difference between their introduction. \n\nPapa Emeritus II was introduced in 2013, and Papa Emeritus III was introduced in 2015. \n\nThe time difference between 2013 and 2015 is 2 years. \n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so the age difference between Papa Emeritus II and III in months would be 2 * 12 = 24 months.\n\nThe answer is: 24"
