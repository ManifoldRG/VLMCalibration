    "response": "To determine the number of summer pasture sites selected, we need to calculate the sampling intensity and then multiply it by the total number of sites in the study area.\n\nThe sampling intensity is 5%, which means 5% of the total sites were selected.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of sites in the study area. However, the problem statement does not provide this information. \n\nHowever, we can calculate the number of sites that would be selected if 5% of the total sites were selected. Let's assume the total number of sites is 'x'. Then, the number of sites selected would be 5% of 'x', which is 0.05x.\n\nSince we don't know the total number of sites, let's assume the total number of sites is 'y'. Then, the number of sites selected would be 5% of 'y', which is 0.05y.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\nNumber of sites selected = 0.05y\nNumber of sites selected = 5% of total sites\n0.05y = 0.05x\n\nTo solve for 'y', we can divide both sides by 0.05:\n\ny = 0.05x / 0.05\ny = x\n\nNow, we can substitute 'x' with the total number of sites in the study area. However, the problem statement does not provide this information.\n\nSince we cannot calculate the exact number of sites selected, we cannot provide a numerical answer.",
