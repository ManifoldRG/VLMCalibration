The cardiac apex is typically displaced upward and to the left due to the enlargement of the left ventricle in response to the increased workload. A thrill may be felt over the carotid artery due to the turbulence of blood flow around the narrowed aortic valve.

Her mother mentioned that she staed developing breast at the age of 12. She was prescribed OCPs 2 years back by a doctor with no effect. She was having normal stature and was a football player. On examination, breasts were well developed (Tanner's stage 5) and pubic hair was minimal (Tanner's stage 1). What is the most probable diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA: Premature ovarian failure\nB: Turner's syndrome\nC: Miillerian agenesis\nD: Androgen insensitivity\nYour response should end with 'The final answer is [letter]' where [letter] is A, B, C or D.",
    "response": "The patient presents with primary amenorrhea, normal stature, well-developed breasts, minimal pubic hair, and no effect of OCPs. This clinical picture is consistent with a lack of ovarian development, suggesting a disorder of sexual differentiation. Turner's syndrome is characterized by short stature and gonadal dysgenesis, but typically does not present with well-developed breasts and minimal pubic hair. Premature ovarian failure would not explain the lack of puberty progression beyond breast development. Androgen insensitivity would not explain the well-developed breasts and minimal pubic hair. The most likely diagnosis is a condition where there is a failure in the development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts, leading to primary amenorrhea and underdeveloped vagina, while the development of the rest of the body is normal due to the presence of testosterone.

    "response": "In renal failure, drugs are dose-adjusted based on their clearance and potential to accumulate and cause toxicity. Amphotericin B is primarily cleared renally, so dose reduction is necessary in renal failure. Vancomycin is primarily cleared by the liver and not significantly altered by renal function, so it typically does not require dose adjustment for renal failure. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside that is primarily cleared by the kidneys; thus, dose adjustments are necessary in renal failure to prevent toxicity. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is not significantly affected by renal function and does not require dose adjustment for renal impairment. The final answer is D",

The administration of antenatal corticosteroids can actually decrease the risk of RDS in term infants. The onset of distress after 6 hours of birth is not a typical feature of RDS, as term infants usually do not develop RDS. Term birth itself does not predispose to RDS.

This process consumes platelets and clotting factors, leading to decreased levels of these components. Fibrinogen, a clotting factor, is typically consumed in DIC, resulting in decreased levels of fibrinogen. Thrombocytopenia, or a decrease in platelet count, is also a common feature of DIC due to the consumption and destruction of platelets. Normal APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) and PT (prothrombin time) are not typical in DIC. PT measures the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways, and in DIC, these pathways are often activated, leading to PT elevation.

    "response": "The baby presents with respiratory distress, surfactant unresponsiveness, and an echocardiogram without abnormalities, along with a ground-glass appearance on chest X-ray and a negative culture. The history of a sibling's death adds a significant clinical clue. Meconium aspiration syndrome typically presents with respiratory distress and hypoxia but usually responds to surfactant therapy. Neonatal pulmonary alveolar proteinosis causes a ground-glass appearance on chest X-ray and can present with respiratory distress but usually has a better response to surfactant therapy and often has a more chronic course. Diffuse herpes simplex infection is less likely to cause these findings and typically presents with more systemic symptoms and rash. The clinical picture and the lack of response to surfactant therapy are more suggestive of a problem with the lungs rather than a systemic infection. The ground-glass appearance on X-ray and the lack of response to surfactant therapy are particularly suggestive of a lung disease. Given the context of the baby's distress and the sibling's death, a genetic or inherited lung disease could be considered, but the immediate presentation points more towards a neonatal lung pathology.

The patient's age and the acute onset of symptoms, including seizures and unconsciousness, are more suggestive of an acute infection rather than a chronic condition like tubercular meningitis. Herpes encephalitis typically presents with fever, headache, and altered mental status but is more commonly associated with a preceding rash and often has a more specific CSF profile with increased eosinophils and elevated IgG antibodies against herpes simplex virus.

    "response": "The resolving power of a microscope depends on several factors, including the size of the aperture, the focal length of the eyepiece, the thickness of the film (or the objective lens in the case of compound microscopes), and the wavelength of light source used. Among these factors, the thickness of the film (or objective lens) directly influences the resolving power because it affects how sharply the image can be focused. The focal length of the eyepiece and the wavelength of light source contribute to the overall magnification and clarity but do not directly determine the resolving power in the same way the aperture and objective lens do. Therefore, the option that does not directly affect the resolving power is the thickness of the film. The final answer is C.",

    "response": "Ectodermal dysplasia is a group of genetic disorders that affect the ectodermal tissues, which include the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. People with ectodermal dysplasia often exhibit various symptoms, including defective or absent sweat glands. Sweat glands are crucial for regulating body temperature through sweating, and their absence or dysfunction can lead to hyperpyrexia, which is an abnormally high fever. Protuberant lips and frontal bossing are not typical features of ectodermal dysplasia. Therefore, the correct answer that includes defective or absent sweat glands and hyperpyrexia is D.

This happens when the period of stimulation (stimulus application time) is less than the total cycle time of the muscle's response.\n\nGiven the total cycle time is 100 ms, the tetanizing frequency (f) is calculated as:\nf = 1 / (total cycle time) = 1 / 100 ms = 10 Hz\n\nHowever, this calculation gives us the reciprocal of the cycle time in milliseconds, which represents the frequency in hertz (Hz).

Golden colour stool in breast-fed infants is due to the presence of bile in the stool, which is normal and expected. Prolongation of physiological jaundice, which is a yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes due to high levels of bilirubin in the blood, can occur in breast-fed infants. This is a normal variation and usually resolves on its own. The final answer is D",

Nerve injury related manifestations in these cases can be permanent rather than transitory because the nerves involved (such as the radial nerve) can sustain significant damage during the fracture and healing process. This can lead to long-term weakness or loss of function in the affected arm, particularly in elbow flexion. The final answer is D.",

However, atropine should be administered cautiously and only if organophosphates are suspected, and its use should be guided by clinical judgment and laboratory findings. The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which could be due to vasodilation or bradycardia, common in organophosphate poisoning.

Her blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg. A lower segment caesarean section was planned in view of acute shock. What type of anesthesia will you plan for this patient?\nOptions:\nA: General anesthesia with IV induction by ketamine\nB: Spinal anesthesia up to L4 level\nC: General anesthesia with IV induction by propofol followed by maintenance with fluranes\nD: Sedation and epidural analgesia\nYour response should end with 'The final answer is [letter]' where [letter] is A, B, C or D.",
    "response": "The patient is in acute shock and requires immediate intervention to stabilize her condition before proceeding with surgery. Given her low blood pressure and the need for a rapid response, general anesthesia with IV induction by propofol followed by maintenance with fluranes would provide the quickest and most effective control over her airway, breathing, and circulation. This approach allows for rapid induction, quick control of the patient's vital functions, and the ability to adjust the level of anesthesia as needed during the surgery. The use of fluranes is also advantageous as they can be quickly adjusted to maintain hemodynamic stability. Additionally, propofol is a short-acting hypnotic agent that can be titrated to effect and has a minimal effect on blood pressure, making it a good choice for induction in a hemodynamically compromised patient.

    "response": "When a driver wearing a seat belt applies the brake suddenly, the force is distributed across the body, but the parts most vulnerable to injury are those that are not well protected or are more freely movable. The abdominal aorta (AoA) is not a body part that would be injured in this scenario as it is protected within the abdominal cavity. The liver, spleen, and mesentery are all located within the abdominal cavity and could potentially be injured in a sudden deceleration. However, among these, the liver is the largest organ and is relatively well protected by the rib cage, making it less likely to be injured in a seat belt collision compared to the spleen and mesentery, which are more freely movable and less protected. The spleen is particularly vulnerable as it is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, not protected by the rib cage, and involved in filtering blood, making it more susceptible to injury during rapid acceleration or deceleration.

The presence of foul breath and exudates points towards a bacterial etiology, and acute glomerulonephritis is a known sequelae of streptococcal infections.\n\nThe final answer is B.",

However, the question asks for an exception, and none of the options directly state that insulin does not have a specific exception related to pregnancy that is listed. The statement about Tolbutamide crossing the placenta is incorrect as it does not cross the placenta, which makes it a poor choice for a pregnant diabetic patient.

    "response": "To determine the volume percentage of filler in dental composite given that filler constitutes 75% by weight, we need to consider the typical density difference between the resin matrix and the filler material. Dental composite typically consists of a resin matrix and a filler (often silica or zirconia) with a higher density.\n\nThe resin matrix is less dense than the filler material. Therefore, 75% by weight of filler does not correspond to 75% by volume because the volume of the filler would be greater due to its higher density.\n\nGiven that the filler is denser, 75% by weight of the composite would correspond to a smaller volume fraction. To calculate the exact volume percentage, we would need the specific densities of the resin matrix and the filler. However, we can make an educated estimate based on typical values:\n\n- Density of resin matrix: ~1.1 to 1.3 g/cm\u00b3\n- Density of filler: ~2.2 to 2.8 g/cm\u00b3\n\nAssuming an average density difference of about 1.7 (2.2 - 1.5), 75% by weight of the composite would be less than 75% by volume. \n\nTo calculate the exact volume percentage, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume percentage of filler} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Weight percentage of filler} \\times \\text{Density of filler}}{\\text{Density of filler} + \\text{Density of resin matrix}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume percentage of filler} = \\left( \\frac{75\\% \\times 2.2 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3}{2.2 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 + 1.3 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume percentage of filler} = \\left( \\frac{0.75 \\times 2.2}{3.5} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume percentage of filler} = \\left( \\frac{1.65}{3.5} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume percentage of filler} \\approx 47.14\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, 75% by weight of filler in dental composite is approximately 47.14% by volume.\n\nThe final answer is C.",

    "response": "PTH (Parathyroid Hormone) is primarily responsible for regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. When calcium levels are low, PTH is secreted to increase calcium levels by increasing bone resorption, reducing renal calcium excretion, and increasing intestinal calcium absorption. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) can indeed cause hypercalcemia, particularly in cancer patients, as it is often overexpressed in various cancers. The unionized fraction of calcium in the plasma is crucial for PTH secretion because the hormone binds to its receptor only when calcium is ionized (i.e., not bound to proteins). This binding triggers the secretion of PTH. Magnesium (Mg2+) influences PTH secretion; it does so by acting on a calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) located not only in the parathyroid gland but also in the kidneys and intestines. When Mg2+ levels are high, the CaSR senses this and reduces PTH secretion because the perceived calcium level is higher due to the high magnesium concentration. Therefore, Ca2+ influences PTH secretion by acting on a calcium sensor G-protein coupled receptor located in the parathyroid gland, among other tissues. The statement that best encapsulates this understanding is: D. Ca2+ influences PTH secretion by acting on a calcium sensor G-protein coupled receptor located in the parathyroid gland.

This leads to an accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate and a reduction in the availability of phosphate groups, which are needed for glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. As a result, patients often experience hypoglycemia due to the inability to maintain adequate blood glucose levels. Additionally, ketosis can occur because the body cannot generate sufficient glucose for energy, leading to the breakdown of fatty acids and the production of ketones. Oxaloacetate is indeed required for gluconeogenesis, but its involvement does not directly explain the ketosis or hypoglycemia in Von-Gierke's disease.

    "response": "The child presents with a combination of dental and skeletal Class II malocclusion, characterized by a small chin, distal relation of the second molars, and a narrow maxilla. The normal SNA angle suggests that the mandible is relatively normal in position, while the decreased SNB angle and low FMA angle indicate a retrognathic mandible relative to the maxilla. These findings suggest a genetic predisposition to a vertical malocclusion, possibly of genetic type II according to Angle's classification, which is often associated with a high risk of developing periodontal problems and occlusal discrepancies over time.\n\nGiven the child's age and the early presentation of malocclusion, proactive treatment is warranted to prevent future complications and to guide the growth of the jaws in a favorable direction. The FR II (Frankel Rapid Palatal Expander) appliance is a suitable choice for this patient. This appliance can be used to widen the palatal segment of the maxilla, which is often the primary growth component in young patients with a narrow maxilla. The FR II can also help in correcting the low FMA angle by improving the vertical dimension of occlusion.\n\nThe FR II appliance is indicated in this scenario because it addresses the primary issue of a narrow maxilla and can help in improving the occlusal vertical dimension, which is crucial in preventing future dental and skeletal problems. It is a non-invasive and effective way to influence maxillary growth in young patients.\n\nThe final answer is C.",

    "response": "The patient presents with polyuria and polydipsia, along with a low serum sodium (154 mEq/L) and a high serum bicarbonate (22 mEq/L). The serum osmolality is within normal limits at 295, but the urine specific gravity is low at 1.005, indicating dilute urine. These findings are consistent with diabetes insipidus, a condition characterized by excessive urine production and excessive thirst due to impaired water reabsorption by the kidneys. The low serum sodium and high serum bicarbonate levels suggest that the body is trying to compensate for the loss of sodium and water by retaining bicarbonate, a typical response in conditions like diabetes insipidus. The other options do not fit the presented clinical picture as well: Renal tubular acidosis typically presents with metabolic acidosis, Barter's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, and recurrent UTI would not explain the laboratory findings without evidence of infection or other metabolic abnormalities.

Observation and restoration with composite resin (D) are not appropriate for a fracture of this severity, especially considering the risk of pulp necrosis. Taking a radiograph (A) is essential to assess the extent of the fracture and determine pulp vitality. However, the primary concern is the pulp status, which requires immediate attention.

    "response": "The presence of E. coli in a urine culture at a high titre, especially in a child, typically indicates a urinary tract infection (UTI). Given that the child is asymptomatic, the infection may not be causing immediate distress, but it is important to monitor the situation. The asymptomatic nature of the child suggests that the infection might not require immediate aggressive treatment, but it is crucial to follow up to ensure it does not progress or cause complications. The choice of prophylactic antibiotics for 6 months is an option that could prevent future UTIs, especially in children who are predisposed to recurrent infections due to anatomical factors or other predisposing conditions. This approach is particularly recommended in children who have had multiple episodes of UTIs, have structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, or are at high risk for complications.

    "response": "The sensitivity to chewing pressure in a patient with a newly inserted distal extension partial denture, especially just 3 weeks post-insertion, is likely due to the denture not fitting perfectly or having an improper occlusion. This can cause stress and pressure on the tissues supporting the denture, leading to discomfort. The denture might be too high or not properly adjusted, causing pain when pressure is applied during chewing. The discomfort could also be due to the clasp potentially causing abrasion on the tooth structure, but this would typically be noticed sooner.

    "response": "The patient's normal blood glucose level estimated by the glucose-oxidase peroxidase method indicates that the issue is not with blood glucose levels but rather with the excretion of glucose into the urine, which is indicated by the positive Benedict's test in urine. This phenomenon is characteristic of diabetes mellitus, where high blood glucose levels lead to spilling glucose into the urine. Galactosemia is a genetic disorder where the body cannot properly break down galactose, a sugar component of lactose, leading to its accumulation in the blood and other tissues, but it does not cause positive Benedict's test. Fructosemia involves the abnormal metabolism of fructose, which also does not cause positive Benedict's test. Denaturation of glucose is not a metabolic disorder but rather a physical change that does not affect the chemical properties of glucose, including its ability to react with Benedict's reagent in a positive test. The false positive result could be due to contamination or other factors, but it is not the most likely cause given the context.

    "response": "PCOS patients often have elevated androgen levels, which can cause hirsutism and irregular bleeding. Spironolactone is a diuretic that also acts as an antiandrogen, making it effective in managing hirsutism by reducing androgen levels. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used primarily for breast cancer treatment and has no direct role in managing PCOS symptoms. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgen levels, but they are not the first-line treatment for PCOS. Clomiphene citrate is a common medication used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS by stimulating the ovaries to produce more follicles. However, it can also increase androgen levels, potentially worsening hirsutism. Given the context of managing PCOS symptoms, particularly hirsutism, Tamoxifen would not be the appropriate choice due to its lack of direct action on androgen levels. The final answer is B.",

These findings are consistent with a physical blockage or dysfunction in the outer or middle ear. Otosclerosis, a condition involving abnormal bone growth in the stapes bone of the middle ear, is a common cause of progressive conductive hearing loss that can improve in noisy environments due to the amplification effect of bone conduction.

To increase cardiac output, the heart can either increase its stroke volume (the amount of blood it pumps with each beat) or increase its heart rate. Since the stroke volume cannot increase indefinitely due to physical limits, the heart initially increases its stroke volume to meet the increased demand for blood flow. However, as exercise intensity increases, the heart reaches its maximum stroke volume and cannot increase it further. To maintain cardiac output beyond this point, the heart rate must increase. Therefore, end systolic volume (ESV), which is the volume remaining in the ventricle at the end of systole (heart contraction), will initially decrease as the heart contracts more forcefully to increase stroke volume. But as the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output, the heart starts to fill less between beats, leading to an increase in ESV over time. The final answer is C.",

    "response": "Non-visualization of the gallbladder in hepatic scintigraphy is often associated with conditions that either prevent the gallbladder from filling with contrast agent or significantly reduce its activity. Chronic cholecystitis, characterized by long-standing inflammation of the gallbladder, can lead to scarring and fibrosis that impairs the gallbladder's ability to contract and fill with contrast during the imaging procedure. This condition can result in the gallbladder appearing non-visualized. Gallstones, particularly if they are large or numerous, can also obstruct the cystic duct, preventing the gallbladder from properly filling with contrast. This scenario is more aligned with acute cholecystitis due to gallstones, but the question specifically asks about non-visualization, which is more suggestive of chronic changes rather than an acute obstruction.

    "response": "Given the symptoms of abdominal colic and hematuria along with the ultrasound finding of a renal stone measuring 2.5 cm in diameter, this suggests a significant obstruction that is likely causing significant pain and potential complications. The presence of a large stone in the renal pelvis indicates that it is not easily passed and may require intervention to prevent further complications such as infection or chronic kidney damage. Among the options provided, pyelolithotomy is the surgical procedure that involves the removal of a stone from the renal pelvis and calyces. This procedure is appropriate for a stone that is too large to be treated with less invasive methods and poses a risk to the patient if left in place. Nephroureterostomy is a more extensive procedure involving the removal of the entire kidney and the ureter, which is not indicated here as the goal is to remove the stone and preserve renal function. Conservative management would involve observation and pain management, which is not suitable for a symptomatic, large stone that is causing obstruction. Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive procedure used to break stones into smaller pieces that can be passed naturally, but it is typically used for stones located in the ureter and not in the renal pelvis, especially for larger stones. The patient's presentation and the size of the stone suggest that a surgical approach is warranted. The final answer is A.",

    "response": "When a pregnancy extends beyond 42 weeks, it is considered postdated or postmature. Postdated pregnancies increase the risk of complications for both the mother and the fetus. The initial evaluation for a postdated pregnancy should focus on the well-being of the mother and the fetus, assessing fetal health and readiness for labor. Induction of labour is a common and often recommended approach to manage postdated pregnancies to prevent potential complications such as stillbirth or perinatal asphyxia. Review of previous menstrual history is important but is not the immediate priority in an evaluation for postdated pregnancy. A USG (Ultrasound) can provide information about the size of the fetus, amniotic fluid levels, and placental function, which are important factors in the decision-making process for managing a postdated pregnancy. However, the primary initial action is to consider induction of labour to reduce the risks associated with prolonged pregnancy. The final answer is A.",

Sideroblastic anemia involves defects in heme synthesis and is not typically associated with low iron levels, leading to normal or high iron stores but abnormal iron utilization. Thalassemia is an inherited disorder that results in reduced or absent production of one or more globin chain of hemoglobin, leading to microcytic, hypochromic RBCs but usually with normal iron stores. Folic acid deficiency anemia occurs when there is a lack of folic acid, leading to larger than normal RBCs (macrocytosis) but not necessarily hypochromic. Given the low hemoglobin and hematocrit with a low RBC count, the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia. The final answer is A.",

Meniere's disease typically presents with episodic vertigo, hearing fluctuations, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ear, but it is not usually bilateral or hereditary in the same way conductive hearing loss can be. Otospongiosis is a rare condition that involves the destruction of the temporal bone, leading to hearing loss, but it is not typically bilateral or hereditary in a straightforward manner. Tympanosclerosis is a benign condition that leads to stiffness and scarring of the tympanic membrane and middle ear structures, often resulting in conductive hearing loss, but it is not typically associated with tinnitus or a strong family history. B/L otitis media (bilateral otitis media) refers to inflammation of the middle ear that can cause conductive hearing loss and might be bilateral if the infection is widespread, but it usually does not present with tinnitus or a strong family history unless there is a genetic predisposition to ear infections. The description of bilateral conductive deafness, tinnitus, and a positive family history points towards a genetic inner ear disorder.

Pulpotomy is a procedure that involves removing the coronal pulp and placing a medicament in the pulp chamber, but it is typically used for partially erupted teeth with acute pulpitis. Root canal treatment (RCT) is a more invasive procedure that involves removing the pulp tissue from the root canals and filling them, which is not indicated for deep caries without pulpitis in a child. Extraction of teeth is a definitive treatment that should be considered only when the tooth cannot be saved or when it poses a risk to the patient's health.

    "response": "Ostatic hypotension refers to a condition where an individual's blood pressure drops when they stand up from a lying or sitting position, typically due to blood pooling in the lower extremities. The key characteristic is a significant drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) upon standing. The provided options describe different scenarios of blood pressure changes upon standing. \n\nOption A describes a drop in both SBP and DBP (diastolic blood pressure) but within a relatively short timeframe of 3 minutes, which could be indicative of a rapid form of hypotension upon standing.\n\nOption B describes a longer timeframe of 6 minutes for the SBP drop, which is slower and might not be as characteristic of ostatic hypotension.\n\nOption C describes a more pronounced drop in SBP but within the same 3-minute timeframe as Option A, suggesting a more significant hypotensive response upon standing.\n\nOption D describes an even more extreme drop in SBP and DBP over a longer period of 6 minutes, which is not typical of ostatic hypotension.\n\nConsidering the definition and the characteristics of ostatic hypotension, Option A best fits the description.

The glass particles are embedded within the polysaccharide matrix, and when the cement sets, it forms a polymerized network that mechanically locks the glass particles in place. There is no direct ionic or covalent bonding between the glass particles and the resin matrix in the setting process. Instead, the setting reaction involves the formation of calcium-silicate hydrate (CSH) through a polycondensation reaction between the glass and the acidic components of the cement.
