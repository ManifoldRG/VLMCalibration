In iron deficiency anemia, TIBC increases as the body tries to capture more iron from the diet.\n- Ferritin: This is a protein that stores iron in the body. In iron deficiency anemia, ferritin levels decrease, indicating that the body's iron stores are depleted.\n- Transferrin saturation: This is the percentage of transferrin (a protein that binds iron) that is saturated with iron.

The amount of mercury in an admixed alloy can vary widely depending on the specific composition and the desired properties of the alloy. Therefore, it's not a reliable indicator of the minimum amount of mercury required.\n\nB. Spherical: The shape of a spherical alloy can affect its properties, but it does not directly relate to the amount of mercury required. Spherical shapes can be achieved through various manufacturing processes, and the amount of mercury used in the process is not necessarily the same as the minimum required.\n\nC.

The amount of mercury in a hybrid alloy can vary depending on the specific composition and the desired properties of the alloy. Therefore, it's not a reliable indicator of the minimum amount of mercury required.\n\nD.

Therefore, the time taken to convert the substrate into the same amount of product (12 micrograms/ml) is:\n\nTime = (New V / Initial V) * 9 minutes\nTime = (48 * 10^-6 / 24 * 10^-6) * 9 minutes\nTime = 1.5 * 9 minutes\nTime = 13.5 minutes\n\nThe final answer is D.",

Therefore, the time taken to convert the substrate into the same amount of product (12 micrograms/ml) is:\n\nTime = (New V / Initial V) * 9 minutes\nTime = (48 * 10^-6 / 24 * 10^-6) * 9 minutes\nTime = 1.5 * 9 minutes\nTime = 13.5 minutes\n\nThe final answer is D."
