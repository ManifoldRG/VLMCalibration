Here's why:\n\n* **Adverse events** often occur when a drug or substance binds to unintended targets (secondary targets) in addition to its intended target (primary target). \n\n* **Binding sites** are specific regions on molecules where other molecules can attach.  \n\n* For a drug to bind to a secondary target, that target needs to have a binding site that is **structurally similar** to the binding site on the primary target. This similarity allows the drug to bind, even if it wasn't intended to.\n\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n* **A: Should be present in the same tissue as the primary target:** While proximity can increase the chance of interaction, it's not a requirement for binding.\n* **C: Should have absolutely identical secondary structure:**  Secondary structure refers to local folding patterns within a protein. While similar secondary structures can contribute to binding,  it's not the primary factor.\n* **D: Should have a similar primary structure:**  Primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids.  Similarity in primary structure doesn't necessarily mean similar binding sites.\n\n\nThe final answer is **B**.\n",

Keeping these settings consistent ensures that each radiograph is exposed to the same amount of radiation, resulting in images with similar density and contrast.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A: Long cone technique:** This technique affects the size and shape of the radiographic image, not its consistency.\n* **C: Automatic processing:** While automatic processing helps standardize the development process, it doesn't directly control the initial exposure settings.\n* **D: Proper developing:** Proper developing ensures the image is properly formed, but it doesn't guarantee consistency across multiple radiographs if the exposure settings vary.\n\n\nThe final answer is B. \n",

    "response": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n* **Anomic aphasia:** Characterized by difficulty finding the right words (naming objects), but generally good comprehension and fluency. This matches the patient's symptoms.\n\n* **Broca's aphasia:**  Involves difficulty producing speech, leading to slow, halting, and grammatically incorrect sentences. Comprehension is usually good. This doesn't fit the description of fluent speech.\n\n* **Transcortical sensory aphasia:**  Similar to Wernicke's aphasia (fluent but nonsensical speech), but with better repetition ability. This doesn't align with the patient's poor repetition.\n\n* **Conduction aphasia:**  Difficulty repeating words despite good comprehension and fluency.

    "response": "Vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to the phenomenon where a drug that initially causes vasoconstriction (like noradrenaline) is followed by a drug that causes vasodilation (like adrenaline). This reversal occurs because adrenaline acts on beta-adrenergic receptors, which can cause vasodilation, overriding the vasoconstriction caused by noradrenaline.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n* **A: Propranolol followed by adrenaline:** Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which would block the vasodilatory effects of adrenaline. This doesn't demonstrate vasomotor reversal.\n* **B: Propranolol followed by noradrenaline:** Propranolol wouldn't directly influence noradrenaline's vasoconstrictive effects.\n* **C: Decrease in heart rate on adrenaline administration after phentolamine has been given:** Phentolamine blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors, which are responsible for vasoconstriction.  Adrenaline, acting primarily on beta-adrenergic receptors, would still cause vasodilation even after phentolamine. This doesn't demonstrate vasomotor reversal.\n* **D: Noradrenaline followed by propranolol:** This sequence aligns with vasomotor reversal. Noradrenaline causes vasoconstriction, and propranolol, by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, would prevent the potential vasodilation that adrenaline might cause.\n\nThe final answer is **D**.\n",

    "response": "Here's how to determine the tetanizing frequency:\n\n* **Understanding Tetanus:** Tetanus occurs when muscle fibers are stimulated so rapidly that they don't have time to fully relax between contractions. This results in a sustained, powerful contraction.\n\n* **Key Factors:** The tetanizing frequency is the rate of stimulation needed to prevent complete relaxation between contractions.  It's influenced by the latent period, contraction time, and relaxation time.\n\n* **Calculation:**  The tetanizing frequency is generally considered to be around 20-30 times the reciprocal of the total duration of a twitch cycle (latent period + contraction time + relaxation time).\n\n1. **Total Twitch Duration:** 10 ms (latent) + 40 ms (contraction) + 50 ms (relaxation) = 100 ms\n\n2. **Tetanizing Frequency (approx.):** 1 / (100 ms) * 25 = 25 Hz\n\n\n\nThe final answer is A. \n",

    "response": "Weber-Fechner's law describes the relationship between the intensity of a stimulus and the perceived change in that stimulus.  \n\nHere's why the correct answer is **C: Number of neurons stimulated**:\n\n* **Weber-Fechner's Law** states that the just noticeable difference (the minimum change in stimulus needed to be perceived) is proportional to the magnitude of the original stimulus.  \n\n* **More neurons stimulated = Stronger perception:**  As the intensity of a stimulus increases, more sensory receptors are activated. This leads to more neurons firing action potentials, and a stronger signal being sent to the brain. This increased firing rate is what allows us to perceive a stronger stimulus.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A: Intensity of stimulus:** While related, Weber-Fechner's law focuses on the *change* in perceived intensity, not the absolute intensity itself.\n* **B: Amplitude of action potential:** The amplitude of an action potential is relatively constant. It's the *frequency* of action potentials that changes with stimulus intensity.\n* **D: Number of receptors stimulated:**  While more receptors being stimulated contributes to a stronger signal, Weber-Fechner's law emphasizes the relationship between the *change* in stimulus and the *change* in perception, which is more directly related to the number of neurons firing. \n\n\nThe final answer is C.\n",

Type 1 nuclear bag fibers are specialized for detecting static muscle length changes. They have low myosin ATPase activity, meaning they contract slowly and weakly.\n\n* **C: Peripheral zone has no actin and myosin** - This is **incorrect**. The peripheral zone of the muscle spindle contains contractile proteins (actin and myosin) similar to extrafusal muscle fibers. This allows the spindle to adjust its length and sensitivity.\n\n* **D: Type 2 nuclear bag has high level of myosin ATPase activity** - This is **correct**.

    "response": "The most appropriate flap-based procedure for pilonidal sinus surgery is a **rotational flap**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Pilonidal sinus** is a chronic condition involving a tract or tunnel in the skin near the tailbone, often leading to abscesses and recurrent infections.\n* **Rotational flaps** are designed to cover the defect created during pilonidal sinus surgery by rotating a flap of skin and subcutaneous tissue from a nearby area. This provides good blood supply and coverage for the wound.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less suitable:\n\n* **Rhomboid flap:**  This type of flap is typically used for smaller defects and may not be sufficient for the size of the wound often associated with pilonidal sinus.\n* **Circular flap:**  Similar to the rhomboid flap, this is generally used for smaller defects and may not be ideal for the complex anatomy of pilonidal sinus.\n* **Free flap:**  Free flaps involve transferring a flap from a distant site and require microsurgical techniques.

    "response": "The correct answer is **B: It is less protein bound**. Here's why:\n\n* **Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)** is designed to have a more predictable and consistent anticoagulant effect compared to unfractionated heparin.  \n\n* **Protein binding** is a key factor in this difference. Unfractionated heparin binds strongly to proteins in the blood, which can lead to variable levels of active heparin in circulation. LMWH, due to its smaller size, binds less to proteins, resulting in a more consistent and reliable anticoagulant effect.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A: It interferes with thrombin and antithrombin III simultaneously:** While both unfractionated heparin and LMWH work by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, which then inhibits thrombin, this is not the primary reason for LMWH's reliable action.\n* **C: It is given subcutaneously:**  The route of administration (subcutaneous vs. intravenous) is important for convenience and patient compliance, but it doesn't directly explain the difference in reliability.\n* **D: It is cleared by macrophages:** Both unfractionated heparin and LMWH are cleared from the body by the liver and kidneys.\n\n\nThe final answer is **B**.\n",

Colistin is a last-resort antibiotic for multi-drug resistant bacteria.\n* **B: Carbapenems with 3rd generation cephalosporins** - Carbapenems are broad-spectrum antibiotics with good activity against Burkholderia cepacia. Combining them with 3rd generation cephalosporins provides broader coverage.\n* **C: Tigecycline and cefipime** - Tigecycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with activity against some resistant strains. Cefipime is a 4th generation cephalosporin, which may have better activity than 3rd generation.\n* **D: Cotrimoxazole with 3rd generation cephalosporins** - Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is not generally recommended for Burkholderia cepacia due to high resistance rates.\n\n**The final answer is B** \n\n\n",

    "response": "Here's the reasoning:\n\n* **JVP (Jugular Venous Pressure)** is a reflection of pressure in the right atrium of the heart. \n\n* **Deep Y descent** in JVP is a specific pattern seen on a waveform tracing that indicates a rapid filling of the right atrium followed by a sudden drop in pressure. This typically occurs when there is obstruction to blood flow out of the right ventricle.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n* **A: Cardiac tamponade:**  This condition involves fluid buildup around the heart, restricting its ability to fill. This leads to a classic \"x descent\" and \"y descent\" pattern in JVP, not a deep Y descent.\n* **B: RCM (Right-sided cardiomyopathy):**  This weakens the right ventricle, making it harder to pump blood. This can lead to elevated JVP and a deep Y descent as blood backs up into the right atrium.\n* **C: Constrictive pericarditis:**  This involves thickening of the pericardium (sac around the heart), restricting its filling. Similar to cardiac tamponade, it can cause elevated JVP but not a deep Y descent.\n* **D: Tricuspid regurgitation:** This is a leak in the tricuspid valve, allowing blood to flow back into the right atrium.

    "response": "Here's how to break down the answer:\n\n* **Metabolic Acidosis:**  The patient has metabolic acidosis because the HCO3- (bicarbonate) is low (25, normal range 22-26).\n* **Anion Gap:** The anion gap is calculated as Na - (Cl + HCO3). In this case, it's 145 - (100 + 25) = 20. A normal anion gap is 8-16 mEq/L.  \n\n* **Interpretation:** Since the anion gap is elevated (20), this indicates a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\nThe patient also has a slightly elevated pH (7.40, normal range 7.35-7.45) and a normal pCO2. This suggests a mild metabolic alkalosis component, but the primary abnormality is the high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\n\nThe final answer is **B**. \n",

    "response": "Here's the reasoning:\n\n* **Severe dehydration:** The child's symptoms point to severe dehydration: 22-25 stools/day, no urine output for 36 hours, and low blood pressure. \n* **Metabolic acidosis:**  A blood pH of 7.21 indicates metabolic acidosis, often associated with dehydration.\n* **Elevated urea and creatinine:**  High serum urea (120) and creatinine (1.2) suggest kidney dysfunction.\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n\n* **A: Acute cortical necrosis:**  This typically involves bilateral kidney damage and is often associated with severe hypotension and shock. While the child has low blood pressure, it's not the primary indicator of this condition.\n* **B: Acute tubular necrosis:** This is caused by damage to the kidney tubules, often due to ischemia (lack of blood flow).  Dehydration can lead to ischemia, making this a strong possibility.\n* **C: Pre-renal Azotemia:** This occurs when there's reduced blood flow to the kidneys (often due to dehydration), leading to elevated urea and creatinine. This aligns well with the child's symptoms.\n* **D: Acute medullary necrosis:** This is less common and usually associated with specific toxins or infections.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of severe dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and elevated urea and creatinine strongly suggests **pre-renal azotemia (C)** as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n\nThe final answer is C",

But the patient did not give much care. During follow-up, patient was repeatedly told to get the dressing done timely but patient didn't do the dressing himself, saying that he was busy. Finally the wound enlarged and the underlying bone developed osteomyelitis. Which of the following statement is true regarding above-mentioned situation?\nOptions:\nA: Doctor is guilty under \"Last clear chance\" doctrine\nB: Doctor is not guilty under \"Contributory negligence\"\nC: Doctor is punishable under avoidable negligence\nD: Doctor is guilty as he prescribed wrong medicines\nYour response should end with 'The final answer is [letter]' where [letter] is A, B, C or D.",
    "response": "The correct answer is **C: Doctor is punishable under avoidable negligence**. Here's why:\n\n* **Avoidable Negligence:** This refers to a situation where a healthcare professional fails to take reasonable steps to prevent harm, even though those steps were within their power to take.  \n\nIn this case, the doctor clearly advised the patient on the importance of regular wound dressings. The patient's lack of compliance is a factor, but the doctor's responsibility lies in ensuring the patient understands the risks of non-compliance and potentially taking further steps to encourage adherence (e.g., providing written instructions, scheduling reminders, involving family members).\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A: Doctor is guilty under \"Last clear chance\" doctrine:** This doctrine applies in situations where the injured party also contributed to their harm, but the defendant had the last opportunity to prevent the harm. This doesn't fit the scenario as the doctor repeatedly advised the patient.\n* **B: Doctor is not guilty under \"Contributory negligence\":** Contributory negligence focuses on the injured party's own negligence contributing to their harm. While the patient's lack of care was a factor, the doctor's failure to adequately address the situation also contributed to the negative outcome.\n* **D: Doctor is guilty as he prescribed wrong medicines:** There's no indication that the doctor prescribed the wrong medication.

    "response": "Here's the reasoning:\n\n* **Complete wetting (A):**  Complete wetting occurs when a liquid spreads out to cover a surface as much as possible. This usually results in a low contact angle, but not necessarily zero degrees.\n\n* **Rough surfaces (B):** Rough surfaces can influence contact angles, but a zero-degree angle specifically indicates perfect alignment, not just roughness.\n\n* **Adherent and adhesive molecules are tangent to each other (C):** This is the most accurate description. A zero-degree contact angle means the adhesive and adherent surfaces are perfectly aligned, with their molecules touching at a single point.\n\n* **Irregularities present between Adherent surfaces (D):** Irregularities can lead to variations in contact angles, but not necessarily a perfectly zero-degree angle.\n\n\nThe final answer is C.",

    "response": "The correct answer is **B: Prevention of epithelial migration**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **GTR (Guided Tissue Regeneration)** is a surgical technique used to regenerate lost periodontal tissues.  \n\n* A **barrier membrane** is a key component of GTR. Its primary function is to act as a physical barrier, preventing epithelial cells from migrating into the space where new tissue is intended to grow. This allows the underlying connective tissue and bone cells to regenerate without being overgrown by epithelium.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A: To help overall healing:** While barrier membranes contribute to healing, their primary role is specific to guiding tissue regeneration, not just general healing.\n* **C: To stop bleeding:**  Hemostasis (stopping bleeding) is usually achieved through other surgical techniques and materials, not the primary function of a barrier membrane.\n* **D: To prevent the underlying tissues from infection:**  While a barrier membrane can help create a more controlled environment, its main purpose isn't to directly prevent infection.  \n\n\nThe final answer is **B**.\n",

    "response": "Juvenile periodontitis is characterized by rapid and severe bone loss, primarily driven by an overactive inflammatory response.  \n\nHere's why the correct answer is **D: Neutrophil chemotactic defects or Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis**:\n\n* **Neutrophils** are the primary immune cells responsible for fighting bacterial infections in the gums. \n* **Chemotaxis** is the process by which neutrophils are attracted to sites of infection.\n\nIn juvenile periodontitis, defects in neutrophil chemotaxis mean these crucial cells can't effectively reach the infection site in the gums. This leads to uncontrolled bacterial growth and the severe bone loss observed.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A: Cyclic neutropenia:** This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by cyclical drops in neutrophil count, leading to recurrent infections. While it can cause problems, it's not the primary cause of juvenile periodontitis.\n* **B: Lysis of neutrophils:**  This would actually reduce the number of neutrophils available to fight infection, exacerbating the problem.\n* **C: Increased phagocytosis:** While phagocytosis (engulfing and destroying bacteria) is a key function of neutrophils, defects in chemotaxis prevent them from reaching the bacteria in the first place.\n\n\nThe final answer is **D**.\n",

These sugars can then build up in the blood and be excreted in the urine, leading to a positive Benedict's test.\n\n* **Denaturation of glucose (B)** is unlikely to cause a positive Benedict's test as denaturation doesn't change the sugar's ability to reduce.\n\n* **False positive (D)** is possible, but less likely given the specific nature of the Benedict's test.\n\n\nThe final answer is **A**. \n",

While they might discourage certain behaviors, they wouldn't necessarily cause a child to dawdle out of fear.\n* **Rejecting mothers** are emotionally distant and unsupportive. This might lead to behavioral issues, but not specifically evasiveness and dawdling.\n* **Underaffectionate mothers** are less physically and emotionally affectionate. While this could impact a child's development, it's not directly linked to the described behavior.\n\n\nThe most likely explanation based on the child's behavior is an overprotective mother. \n\nThe final answer is A. \n",

On examination, testicular torsion of the right side is suspected. The surgical intervention should be:\nOptions:\nA: Immediate scrotal exploration of the affected side and operate opposite side if symptomatic\nB: Delay exploration and operate opposite side if symptomatic\nC: Immediate exploration of the affected side and operate opposite side even if asymptomatic\nD: Delayed exploration on the affected side along with the opposite side even if asymptomatic\nYour response should end with 'The final answer is [letter]' where [letter] is A, B, C or D.",
    "response": "The correct answer is **A: Immediate scrotal exploration of the affected side and operate opposite side if symptomatic**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency.**  It involves the twisting of the spermatic cord, cutting off blood supply to the testicle.  This can lead to rapid tissue death if not treated promptly.\n* **Immediate exploration is crucial.**  The goal is to detorse the testicle and restore blood flow as quickly as possible. Delaying surgery significantly increases the risk of losing the testicle.\n* **Operating on the opposite side if symptomatic:** While the opposite testicle is not directly involved, it's common practice to explore it as well. This is because there's a higher risk of torsion on the contralateral side (the other testicle) in boys with a history of torsion.\n\n**Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is immediate exploration of the affected side, with the option to explore the opposite side if it shows signs of torsion.**\n\n\nThe final answer is A. \n",

    "response": "The most reliable method for recording centric relation is the **B: Wax cone method**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Wax cone method:** This method uses a pre-formed wax cone that is placed in the patient's mouth. The patient is guided into centric relation, and the cone is imprinted against the teeth. This provides a clear and accurate record of the relationship between the maxillary and mandibular teeth in centric relation.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less reliable:\n\n* **Graphic tracing with excursive movements:** This method involves tracing the jaw movements on a graph, but it can be subjective and prone to error.\n* **Trial and error method:** This method relies on the dentist's experience and judgment, which can vary. It is not as precise as the wax cone method.\n\n\nThe final answer is B. \n",

Deep breaths can increase intrathoracic pressure, potentially worsening tamponade.\n\n* **B: The cuff pressure should be increased to 20 mm over systolic pressure:** This is **correct**.  In tamponade, the pressure changes in the pericardial sac can make it harder to detect blood pressure accurately. Increasing the cuff pressure helps ensure a proper reading.\n\n* **C: The cuff should be slowly deflated until the first Korotkoff sound is heard only during expiration:** This is **correct**.  This technique helps to minimize the impact of the fluctuating pressure changes associated with tamponade.\n\n* **D: Pulses paradoxus may not be present:** This is **correct**.

    "response": "Here's the reasoning:\n\n* **Priority:**  In a situation of massive blood loss, the immediate priority is to restore blood volume and oxygen-carrying capacity. This means red blood cells (PRBCs) are the most critical component.\n\n* **Platelet Function:** While platelets are essential for clotting, they are less urgent in the initial stages of hemorrhagic shock compared to the need for oxygen-carrying blood.\n\n* **Storage:**  Platelets have a shorter shelf life and are sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Storing them at room temperature for an extended period can compromise their viability.\n\n**Therefore, the best course of action is to prioritize the transfusion of PRBCs while storing the platelets at 2-6 degrees Celsius.**\n\n\nThe final answer is D. \n",

A more negative equilibrium potential means the ion is more likely to be inside the cell at rest.\n\n* **Ion X and Y:**  Since X has a less negative equilibrium potential (-30mV) than Y (-40mV), it's more likely to be outside the cell at rest.\n\n* **Ion Z:** The question states the membrane is freely permeable to Z at rest. This means Z likely contributes to the resting membrane potential.\n\n* **Blocking Z:** If a drug blocks the permeability of Z, Z can no longer move across the membrane. This will disrupt the existing balance of ions contributing to the resting membrane potential.\n\n* **The Effect:** Because Z likely contributes to the resting membrane potential, blocking it will shift the membrane potential in the direction of its equilibrium potential.  Without knowing the exact equilibrium potential of Z, we can't definitively say if it's positive or negative.\n\n**However, we can say:**\n\n* If Z's equilibrium potential is more negative than the resting membrane potential, blocking it will cause **hyperpolarization** (more negative).\n* If Z's equilibrium potential is more positive than the resting membrane potential, blocking it will cause **depolarization** (less negative).\n\n\n\n**The final answer is (C)**. \n",

People with Wilson disease have *low* serum copper because it's being stored in tissues, not circulating freely. Urine copper is also typically *high* as the body tries to eliminate excess copper.\n* **B: High ceruloplasmin:** This is incorrect. Ceruloplasmin is a protein that carries copper in the blood. In Wilson disease, ceruloplasmin levels are *low* because less copper is available to bind to it.\n* **C: Low serum copper:** This is **correct**.

Blood sugar if <70 sta dextrose**\n\n* **Airway:**  An unconscious patient could have a compromised airway due to blood or swelling.  This needs immediate attention to prevent aspiration and ensure breathing.\n* **CT Scan:** A CT scan is crucial to assess for intracranial bleeding or other injuries that may require urgent intervention.\n* **Blood Sugar:**  The patient is diabetic and may be hypoglycemic due to the accident or his medication. Checking blood sugar and administering dextrose if necessary is important to stabilize his condition.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less appropriate:\n\n* **A: Send blood for tests, sta IV glucose and send to CT:** While blood tests are important, they are not the immediate priority.  Stabilizing the airway and assessing for head injury take precedence.\n* **B: Sta normal saline and send to CT:** Normal saline is important for fluid resuscitation, but it doesn't address the potential airway issue or hypoglycemia.\n* **C: Dextrose solution, CT scan:**  While dextrose is important, it should be administered only if the blood sugar is low.

Matching the HLA type of the donor platelets to the recipient significantly reduces the risk of rejection.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less suitable:\n\n* **A: Random platelet donor:** Random donors have a higher chance of HLA incompatibility, increasing the likelihood of the patient's immune system rejecting the platelets.\n* **B: Single platelet donor:** While better than random donors, a single donor may still have HLA mismatches.\n* **D: Irradiated platelets:** Irradiation is used to prevent graft-versus-host disease, not to address immune-mediated platelet rejection.\n\n\nThe final answer is C. \n",

    "response": "Here's the reasoning:\n\n* **Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD)** means the patient has severe kidney impairment. This significantly impacts the body's ability to eliminate medications.\n\n* **Injectable insulin** is often the preferred treatment for Type 2 diabetes, especially in advanced cases. However, the patient's preference needs to be considered.\n\n* **Oral hypoglycemic agents** are medications taken by mouth to control blood sugar.  \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n* **A: Linagliptin** and **C: Vildagliptin** are DPP-4 inhibitors. These medications are generally safe in patients with CKD and do not require dose adjustments.\n\n* **B: Repaglinide** is a meglitinide. These medications are rapidly absorbed and can be associated with hypoglycemia, making them less ideal in patients with CKD.\n\n* **D: Glimepiride** is a sulfonylurea. These medications are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.  **Dose adjustments are often necessary in patients with CKD.**\n\n**The final answer is A** \n\n\n",

While it's possible for it to be affected, the location of the tacker makes it less likely.\n* **Genital branch of genitofemoral nerve:** This nerve also runs through the inguinal canal and innervates the skin of the scrotum/labia majora. Similar to the ilioinguinal nerve, the location of the tacker makes it less likely to be the cause of thigh pain. \n\n\nThe final answer is D.\n",
