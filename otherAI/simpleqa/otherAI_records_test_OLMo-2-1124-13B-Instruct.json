Papa Emeritus II and Papa Emeritus III are two different incarnations of this role within the band's narrative.\n\nAs of my last update in April 2023, the specific ages of Ghost's Papa Emeritus II and Papa Emeritus III are not publicly disclosed in detail, including their exact birth dates. However, assuming they are played by real individuals and not fictional characters, the age difference would be calculated based on their actual birth dates.\n\nTo determine the age difference in months, one would need to know the exact birth dates of the two Papa Emeritus personas. Without this specific information, it is impossible to provide a precise numerical answer.\n\nThe answer is: [The answer is unknown without specific birth dates.]\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false? Answer only with the single word 'true' or 'false'."
