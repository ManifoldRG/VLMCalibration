    "response": " When using the Sigma FP with EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization), the maximum shutter speed is determined by the camera's internal stabilization system. The stabilization system can handle up to 5.5 stops of image stabilization, which means it can reduce camera shake by a factor of 32 (2^5.5).\n\nHowever, the stabilization system also introduces a delay in shutter operation, which can affect the maximum shutter speed. The exact maximum shutter speed will depend on the specific camera model and its internal components.\n\nTo find the maximum shutter speed for your Sigma FP, you can refer to the camera's specifications or consult the camera's manual. The answer will be given in units of seconds or fractions of a second.\n\nFor example, the Sigma FP has a maximum shutter speed of 1/2000 second.\n\nThe answer is: 1/2000 second.",

You are given another AI's answer to the following question within <ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER> tags.\n\nQuestion: Given the following question, provide a clear and concise answer.\nQuestion: When using EIS with the Sigma FP, what is my maximum shutter speed?\n\nYour response should end with \"The answer is: [answer]\" where [answer] is your complete answer.\n\n<ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n When using the Sigma FP with EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization), the maximum shutter speed is determined by the camera's internal stabilization system. The stabilization system can handle up to 5.5 stops of image stabilization, which means it can reduce camera shake by a factor of 32 (2^5.5).\n\nHowever, the stabilization system also introduces a delay in shutter operation, which can affect the maximum shutter speed. The exact maximum shutter speed will depend on the specific camera model and its internal components.\n\nTo find the maximum shutter speed for your Sigma FP, you can refer to the camera's specifications or consult the camera's manual. The answer will be given in units of seconds or fractions of a second.\n\nFor example, the Sigma FP has a maximum shutter speed of 1/2000 second.\n\nThe answer is: 1/2000 second.\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false? Answer only with the single word 'true' or 'false'."
