The strike rate is calculated by dividing the number of wickets taken by the number of balls faced. However, the number of balls faced is not given in the question. But we can still calculate the strike rate based on the information given.\n\nThe strike rate is the number of wickets taken per over faced. Since a match in IPL consists of 20 overs, and Harbhajan Singh played 4 matches, the total number of overs faced by him is 4 * 20 = 80 overs.\n\nSince he took 1 wicket in each of the 4 matches, the total number of wickets taken by him is 4.\n\nNow, we can calculate the strike rate by dividing the number of wickets taken by the number of overs faced:\n\nStrike rate = (Number of wickets taken) / (Number of overs faced)\nStrike rate = 4 / 80\nStrike rate = 0.05 or 5%.\n\nSo, the strike rate of Harbhajan Singh in the final match of IPL 2015 was 5%.\nThe answer is: 5%.",

    "response": " Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati was the Chief Justice of India from 1987 to 1995. To find the length of his tenure, we need to subtract the start year from the end year.\n\n1995 - 1987 = 8 years\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the days. Since 1987 was not a leap year, there were 365 days in that year.\n\nThe tenure started in 1987 and ended in 1995, so the total number of days is 8 years * 365 days/year = 2920 days.\n\nBut we also need to consider the days from 1987 to the end of the year. 1987 had 365 - (31 + 28 + 31) = 365 - 90 = 275 days left in the year.\n\nSo the total number of days in the tenure is 2920 + 275 = 3195 days.\n\nTo convert this into years and days, we divide 3195 by 365. The quotient is 8 and the remainder is 305.\n\nSo the length of Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati's tenure as the Chief Justice of India was 8 years and 305 days.

    "response": " Mirza Hameedullah Beg served as the Chief Justice of India from 1973 to 1980. To find the length of his tenure in years and days, we need to calculate the difference between the end date and the start date.\n\nThe start date is 1 January 1973 and the end date is 31 December 1980.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of years: 1980 - 1973 = 7 years.\n\nNow, let's find the number of days in the remaining year (1980). Since 1980 is not a leap year, it has 365 days.\n\nTo find the number of days from 1 January 1973 to 31 December 1973, we can simply count the days: 365 days.\n\nNow, let's add the number of days in the 7 years: 7 * 365 = 2555 days.\n\nAnd add the number of days in the remaining year: 2555 + 365 = 2920 days.\n\nFinally, let's subtract the number of days from the start date to the end date: 365 * 7 + 365 = 2920 days.\n\nSo, Mirza Hameedullah Beg's tenure as the Chief Justice of India was 7 years and 0 days.
