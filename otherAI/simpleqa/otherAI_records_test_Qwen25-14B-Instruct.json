George Frederic Watts was born on February 22, 1817, and Ellen Terry was born on January 27, 1847. The difference in their ages can be calculated by subtracting Ellen Terry's birth year from George Frederic Watts' birth year.\n\n1847 - 1817 = 30\n\nHowever, since Ellen Terry was born in January and George Frederic Watts was born in February, she was actually younger than this simple calculation suggests. Therefore, the age gap between them when they married was slightly less than 30 years.\n\nThe answer is: Slightly less than 30 years\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false? Answer only with the single word 'true' or 'false'."

Mob's brother is Reigen Arataka, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding since Reigen is not actually Mob's brother; he is a fraud spiritualist. The character who is Mob's actual brother has not been introduced in the series yet. However, if we assume you're asking about the Spanish voice actor for Reigen Arataka, the correct information would be that Reigen's Spanish voice actor is Jos\u00e9 Luis Orozco.\n\nThe answer is: Jos\u00e9 Luis Orozco\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false?

Therefore, without specific information pointing to a separate release, it's accurate to say that there isn't a distinct \"first soundtrack\" for Machine Girl.\n\nThe answer is: There isn't a widely recognized or separately released soundtrack for Machine Girl that can be specifically identified as its \"first soundtrack.\"\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false?

Bil Keane, known for his famous comic strip \"The Family Circus,\" did not start in a tabloid but began his career at the Providence Journal Bulletin. However, if we consider the context of tabloids and Bil Keane's early work, it's important to note that his debut was not specifically tied to a tabloid format. Given the information typically available about Bil Keane's career, the specific tabloid that first published his work cannot be pinpointed without additional context or clarification on the exact timeframe and publication type.\n\nThe answer is: The specific tabloid that first published William Aloysius \"Bil\" Keane's first cartoon cannot be definitively identified based on standard biographical information about him.\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false? Answer only with the single word 'true' or 'false'."

Natalia Dmitriyevna Shpiller was born on February 28, 1906, and she died on October 24, 2007.\n\nTo calculate her age at the time of her death, we subtract her birth year from her death year and adjust for the months and days:\n- From February 28, 1906, to February 28, 2007, she would be 101 years old.\n- Since she died on October 24, 2007, she had already turned 101 that year but had not yet reached her 102nd birthday.\n\nTherefore, Natalia Dmitriyevna Shpiller passed away at the age of 101.\n\nThe answer is: 101\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false?
