However, 9 is not a vampire number either, but 18 is not the second vampire number. \n\nThe next number is 27, because 2 + 7 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 27 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 36, because 3 + 6 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 36 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 45, because 4 + 5 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 45 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 54, because 5 + 4 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 54 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 63, because 6 + 3 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number.

However, 72 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 81, because 8 + 1 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 81 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 90, because 9 + 0 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number.

They are defined as follows: a number is a vampire number if the sum of its digits is equal to the number itself. \n\nTo find the second vampire number, we need to start checking numbers from 2 upwards. \n\nThe first vampire number is 2, because 2 is equal to the sum of its digits (2 = 2).\n\nThe second vampire number is 18, because 1 + 8 = 9, but 18 is not a vampire number. However, 9 is not a vampire number either, but 18 is not the second vampire number. \n\nThe next number is 27, because 2 + 7 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 27 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 36, because 3 + 6 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 36 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 45, because 4 + 5 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 45 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 54, because 5 + 4 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 54 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 63, because 6 + 3 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 63 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 72, because 7 + 2 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 72 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 81, because 8 + 1 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 81 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 90, because 9 + 0 = 9, and 9 is a vampire number. However, 90 is not the second vampire number.\n\nThe next number is 99, because 9 + 9 = 18, and 18 is a vampire number.\n\nThe answer is: 99.\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\n"
