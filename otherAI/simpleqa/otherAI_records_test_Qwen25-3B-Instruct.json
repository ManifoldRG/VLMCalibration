However, specific details about his birthplace are not widely documented in public records.\n\nGiven the lack of precise information, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact city. However, considering his later career and the geographical spread of English football clubs during that time, it is plausible that he could have been born in a major English city.\n\nThe answer is: James Brain, born in 1900, was likely born in London, as many prominent English footballers were born there during that period.\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false?

He is best known for creating the comic strip \"Family Circus,\" which he co-created with his wife, Phyllis. The strip started in 1963 and became very popular.\n\nSince \"Channel Chuckles\" was not mentioned as one of Keane's well-known strips, it is likely that this was an earlier work or a less prominent strip. However, without specific historical records or interviews confirming the exact launch year of \"Channel Chuckles,\" it's challenging to pinpoint the exact year.\n\nThe answer is: The exact year of Bil Keane's first syndicated strip, Channel Chuckles, cannot be definitively determined from the given information.\n</ANOTHER_AI_ANSWER>\n\nIs the above answer given by the other AI true or false? Answer only with the single word 'true' or 'false'."
