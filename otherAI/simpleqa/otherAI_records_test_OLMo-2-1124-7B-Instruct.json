    "response": "In recreational mathematics, a vampire number is a number that is the sum of two smaller positive integers in the same number's digits. To find the third vampire number, we need to identify numbers that fit this definition and are not already known as vampire numbers.\n\nThe first vampire number is 153, because 1 + 5 + 3 = 9, which are the digits of 153. The second is 370, since 3 + 7 + 0 = 10, which uses all the digits of 370.\n\nTo find the third vampire number, we systematically check numbers for this property. Let's start with three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 100, 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (not valid since it uses only one digit).\nFor 101, 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (not valid).\nFor 102, 1 + 0 + 2 = 3 (not valid).\nFor 103, 1 + 0 + 3 = 4 (not valid).\nFor 104, 1 + 0 + 4 = 5 (not valid).\nFor 105, 1 + 0 + 5 = 6 (not valid).\nFor 106, 1 + 0 + 6 = 7 (not valid).\nFor 107, 1 + 0 + 7 = 8 (not valid).\nFor 108, 1 + 0 + 8 = 9 (not valid).\nFor 109, 1 + 0 + 9 = 10 (not valid).\n\nContinuing this process, we find:\n\nFor 139, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 (not valid).\nFor 140, 1 + 4 + 0 = 5 (not valid).\nFor 141, 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 (not valid).\nFor 142, 1 + 4 + 2 = 7 (not valid).\nFor 143, 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 (not valid).\nFor 144, 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 (not valid).\nFor 145, 1 + 4 + 5 = 10 (not valid).\nFor 146, 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 (not valid).\nFor 147, 1 + 4 + 7 = 12 (not valid).\nFor 148, 1 + 4 + 8 = 13 (not valid).\nFor 149, 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 (not valid).\nFor 150, 1 + 5 + 0 = 6 (not valid).\n\nFinally, for 153:\n\nFor 153, 1 + 5 + 3 = 9 (which uses all the digits of 153).\n\nThus, 153 is the third vampire number. The answer is: 153",
