    "response": "The Pratt & Whitney R-1340-30 Wasp is a radial engine. To find its horsepower, we need to know its displacement and the number of cylinders. The R-1340-30 Wasp has a displacement of 1,000 cubic inches (16.5 liters) and 30 cylinders.\n\nThe horsepower of an engine is typically calculated using the formula: Horsepower = (Displacement x RPM x 0.75) / 550.\n\nFirst, we need to find the RPM of the engine. The R-1340-30 Wasp has a 30-cylinder engine, and assuming it's a 4-stroke engine, the RPM would be around 1,500-1,800 RPM.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values: Horsepower = (1,000 x 1,500 x 0.75) / 550.\n\nHorsepower = 1,125 / 550\nHorsepower = 2.04\n\nThe answer is: 2.04",
