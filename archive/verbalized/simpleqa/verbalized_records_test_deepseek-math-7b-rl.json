But we can still calculate the strike rate based on the information given.\n\nThe strike rate is calculated as:\n\nStrike Rate = (Number of Wickets / Number of Overs) * 10\n\nSince Harbhajan Singh took 1 wicket in each of the 4 matches, the total number of wickets taken is 4. However, we don't know the number of overs faced by Harbhajan Singh in the final match of IPL 2015.\n\nIf we assume that Harbhajan Singh faced 20 overs in the final match (a standard assumption for a T20 match), then the strike rate can be calculated as:\n\nStrike Rate = (4 / 20) * 10 = 2\n\nSo, the strike rate of Harbhajan Singh in the final match of IPL 2015 is 2.\nThe answer is: 2.",

    "response": " Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati was the Chief Justice of India from 1991 to 2002. To find the length of his tenure, we need to subtract the start year from the end year.\n\n2002 - 1991 = 11 years\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the days. Since 1991 was not a leap year, there were 365 days in that year. So, we need to subtract the number of days from 1991 to the end of 2001 (which is 11 years before 2002).\n\n2001 - 1991 = 10 years\n10 years x 365 days/year = 3650 days\n\nThen, we add the number of days from the start of 2002 to the end of his tenure.\n\n2002 - current year = 1 year\n1 year x 365 days/year = 365 days\n\nSo, the total number of days is 3650 + 365 = 4015 days.\n\nNow, we need to convert the number of days into years and days. Since there are 365 days in a year, we divide the total number of days by 365 and find the remainder.\n\n4015 \u00f7 365 = 11 remainder 16\n\nSo, Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati's tenure as the Chief Justice of India was 11 years and 16 days.

We need to count the number of days from 1 January 1962 to 31 December 1962. There are 365 days in a non-leap year and 366 days in a leap year. Since 1962 is not a leap year, it has 365 days.\n\nSo, the total number of days in the tenure is 12 years * 365 days/year = 4380 days.\n\nTherefore, the length of Mirza Hameedullah Beg's tenure as the Chief Justice of India was 12 years and 0 days.
