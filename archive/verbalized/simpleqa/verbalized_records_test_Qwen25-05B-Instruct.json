    "response": "The total number of lunar eclipses that occurred on Earth in the year 1967 was 0.\n\nExplanation:\nIn 1967, there were no known lunar eclipses occurring on Earth due to the fact that the Moon's orbit around the Sun is not perfectly circular, causing it to move slightly away from the Sun during its phases. This means that when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, it does not appear as a full moon but rather as a partial or annular eclipse. Since this phenomenon did not occur in 1967, we can conclude that there were no lunar eclipses on Earth in 1967.",

The sabres were designed by French inventor Jean-Baptiste Lecomte and were powered by an electric motor that operated through a complex system of wires and switches. This design allowed for more precise control over the weapon's movements compared to traditional wooden or leather swords. However, it wasn't until the introduction of the modern foil saber (which replaced the sabre) in 1936 that the use of electrical equipment became widespread across all fencing disciplines.",

    "response": "The answer is: 1/60\n\nTo explain this in detail:\n\nEIS (Electronic Isolation System) is an advanced camera feature that allows you to capture images without any external lens or filter. In the context of the Sigma FP (FP-2), which is a high-end mirrorless camera, the EIS technology enhances the image quality by reducing noise and introducing a more natural-looking image.\n\nWhen using the Sigma FP with EIS, the maximum shutter speed is typically set to 1/60th of a second. This means that when you press the shutter button, the camera will automatically adjust its exposure settings to ensure that the image captures sharp details at the highest possible shutter speeds while maintaining good low-light performance.\n\nIt's important to note that the exact value may vary slightly depending on the specific model and firmware version of the Sigma FP.

This act led to significant changes in the political landscape of the United States, including the passage of the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which were both controversial at the time.\n\nAlcorn's criticism of the Kansas-Nebraska Act was part of a broader movement within the Republican Party to promote abolitionism and to limit federal power over the issue of slavery. His opposition to this legislation helped to shape the political climate of the early 20th century and contributed to the eventual passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery throughout the country.",

The protest culminated in a series of events that included demonstrations, sit-ins, and even a boycott of IIT admissions.\n\n5.

Macdonald was known for his strong support of the Canadian Confederation movement and his efforts to promote trade and commerce between British North America and the United States.\n\nIn 1840, Macdonald purchased the land that would become the Community Hall building at 23 Grenville Street in Burritts Rapids, Ontario.

This policy was implemented by President Frederik Willem de Klerk after the apartheid regime ended in 1994.\n\nTo elaborate further:\n\n- In 1985, South Africa passed the Parental Leave Act, which established a system of shared parental leave between employers and employees.\n- The act required employers to offer at least one day of paid leave per child born during the mother's maternity period.\n- Fathers were also entitled to share some of these days with their partners.\n- The policy was designed to reduce social tensions caused by the apartheid era and promote family-friendly policies.\n\nThis initiative marked a significant step towards gender equality and workplace flexibility in South Africa.",
