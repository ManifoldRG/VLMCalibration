    "response": " Harbhajan Singh played 4 matches in the final of IPL 2015 and took 1 wicket in each match. The strike rate is calculated by dividing the number of wickets taken by the number of balls faced. However, the number of balls faced is not given in the question. But we can still calculate the strike rate based on the information given.\n\nThe strike rate is calculated as:\n\nStrike Rate = (Number of Wickets / Number of Overs) * 10\n\nSince each match consists of 20 overs and Harbhajan Singh played 4 matches, the total number of overs faced by him is 4 * 20 = 80 overs.\n\nNow, we can calculate the strike rate:\n\nStrike Rate = (1 / 80) * 10 = 0.125 * 10 = 1.25\n\nSo, the strike rate of Harbhajan Singh in the final match of IPL 2015 was 1.25.\nThe answer is: 1.25",

    "response": " Mirza Hameedullah Beg served as the Chief Justice of India from 1950 to 1962. To find the length of his tenure in years and days, we need to calculate the difference between the end and start dates.\n\nThe start date is 1950 and the end date is 1962. To find the number of years, we subtract the start year from the end year: 1962 - 1950 = 12 years.\n\nThe tenure started in 1950 and ended in 1962, so there are no remaining days.\n\nTherefore, the length of Mirza Hameedullah Beg's tenure as the Chief Justice of India was 12 years and 0 days.

    "response": " Joseph Melville Broughton served as a United States Senator from 1869 until his death in 1885. To find out how many months he served, we need to calculate the number of months between these two years.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many years are between 1869 and 1885. We do this by subtracting the start year from the end year: 1885 - 1869 = 16 years.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to find the total number of months: 16 years * 12 months/year = 192 months.\n\nSo, Joseph Melville Broughton served as a United States Senator for 192 months. The answer is: 192",
