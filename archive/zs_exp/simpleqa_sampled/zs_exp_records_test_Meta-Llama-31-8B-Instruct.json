In the novel, Gregor's death is caused by a combination of factors, including his physical transformation into a giant insect, his isolation from society, and his eventual starvation.\n\nIf you could provide more context or clarify which Gregor you are referring to, I would be happy to try and provide a more accurate answer.\n\nHowever, I found that in the TV series \"What We Do in the Shadows\" (not the movie), there is a character named Gregor the Bull, who is a vampire and a friend of the main characters. In the series, Gregor's death is caused by Nadja, who kills him in a fit of rage.\n\nThe answer is: Nadja.",
