Since the range is 16 mm, we can calculate the number of patients as follows:\nNumber of patients = (Range / 2) + 1\nNumber of patients = (16 mm / 2) + 1\nNumber of patients = 8 + 1\nNumber of patients = 9\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quaile. Since the 3rd quaile is 110 mm and the 4th quaile is 114 mm, the range is 4 mm. \n\nNumber of patients = (Range / 2) + 1\nNumber of patients = (4 mm / 2) + 1\nNumber of patients = 2 + 1\nNumber of patients = 3\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 50.",

Each 5 mL amp of the drug contains 200 mg drug. You choose 2 ampules of the drug and decide to mix it with saline to make a 250 mL solution. What should be the flow rate of the drug solution to maintain the BP of the patient (assuming 16 drops = 1 mL)?\nOptions:\nA: 4 drops/min\nB: 8 drops/min\nC: 10 drops/min\nD: 16 drops/min\nYour response should end with 'The final answer is [letter]' where [letter] is A, B, C or D.",
    "response": "To determine the correct flow rate of the drug solution, we need to calculate the total amount of drug administered and the desired concentration.\n\nThe patient's weight is 80 kg, and the dose is 10 mcg/kg/min. The total dose is:\n80 kg x 10 mcg/kg/min = 800 mcg/min\n\nSince each ampule contains 200 mg (or 0.2 g) of the drug, the total amount of drug administered is:\n800 mcg/min / 0.2 g/ampule = 4000 ampules/min\n\nEach 5 mL ampule contains 200 mg of the drug. To find the total volume of the solution, we need to convert the total dose from mcg/min to mg/min:\n800 mcg/min / 1000 mcg/mg = 0.8 mg/min\n\nNow, we can calculate the total volume of the solution:\n0.8 mg/min / 0.2 g/ampule = 4 mL/ampule\n\nSince we have 2 ampules, the total volume of the solution is:\n2 ampules x 4 mL/ampule = 8 mL\n\nTo maintain the desired concentration, we need to calculate the flow rate of the solution:\nDesired concentration = 250 mL / 8 mL = 31.25%\n\nSince 16 drops = 1 mL, we can convert the desired concentration to drops/min:\n31.25% = 31.25% / 1 mL = 31.25 drops/mL\n\nNow, we can calculate the flow rate:\nFlow rate = Desired concentration x Desired volume / Desired drops/min\n= 31.25 drops/mL x 250 mL / 31.25 drops/mL\n= 10 drops/min\n\nThe final answer is B.",

The main difference between the two is the measurement of urea (FeNa) and the calculation of the urine output (UN, x Scr / SNa x Ucr).\n\n- RIFLE criteria: FeNa is used to differentiate between acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and other causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). The FeNa value is used to assess the severity of the injury.\n- KDIGO criteria: The KDIGO criteria use the urine output (UN, x Scr / SNa x Ucr) to differentiate between ATN and other causes of AKI.
