They then went on to win another World Series in 2018 under the management of Alex Cora. However, it's important to note that Alex Cora was fired after the 2017 season and was replaced by Brian Kenny for the 2018 season, but he was not officially the manager during the 2018 World Series victory. The official manager during the 2018 World Series was Craig Rodriguez, who was an interim manager.\n\nGiven this information, the first Red Sox manager to win two World Series titles was Terry Francona, as he managed both teams to World Series victories in 2004 and 2013 (the 2013 title was won under his management).\n\nThe answer is: Terry Francona"
