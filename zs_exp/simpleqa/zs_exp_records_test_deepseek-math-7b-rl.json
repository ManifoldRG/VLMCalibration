    "response": " Mirza Hameedullah Beg served as the Chief Justice of India from 1973 to 1985. To find the length of his tenure in years and days, we need to subtract the start and end dates.\n\nThe start date is 1 January 1973 and the end date is 31 December 1985.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of years: 1985 - 1973 = 12 years.\n\nNow, let's find the number of days. We need to count the number of days from 1 January 1973 to 31 December 1985.\n\nFrom 1 January 1973 to 31 December 1973 (the last year of the tenure): 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1974 to 31 December 1974: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1975 to 31 December 1975: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1976 to 31 December 1976: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1977: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1978 to 31 December 1978: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1979: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1980 to 31 December 1980: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1981: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1982: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1983 to 31 December 1983: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1984 to 31 December 1984: 365 days.\n\nAdding these up, we get a total of 3650 days.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of days in the 12 years from the total number of days. Since each year has 365 days, the total number of days in 12 years is 12 * 365 = 4380 days.\n\nSo, the number of days remaining is 3650 - 4380 = -730 days.\n\nHowever, this result is negative, which means we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and find the error.\n\nUpon reexamination, we realize that we have not accounted for the leap year of 1984, which has 366 days. Let's correct this.\n\nThe total number of days in 12 years (including the leap year of 1984) is 12 * 365 + 366 = 4386 days.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of days remaining: 3650 - 4386 = -736 days.\n\nAgain, this result is negative, which indicates that we have made another mistake. Let's reexamine our calculations once more.\n\nUpon reexamination, we realize that we have not accounted for the fact that the tenure of Mirza Hameedullah Beg started in the middle of a year (1973) and ended in the middle of a year (1985). This means that we need to adjust the number of days in the tenure accordingly.\n\nThe tenure started on 1 January 1973 and ended on 31 December 1985, which is a total of 12 years and 12 months. Since each year has 365 days and each month has approximately 30 days, the total number of days in the tenure can be estimated as 12 * 365 + 12 * 30 = 4380 + 360 = 4740 days.\n\nHowever, this estimate is still greater than the actual number of days in the tenure (3650 days). This indicates that we have made another mistake in our calculations.\n\nUpon reexamination, we realize that we have not accounted for the fact that the tenure of Mirza Hameedullah Beg started in the middle of a year",

Let's reexamine our calculations once more.\n\nUpon reexamination, we realize that we have not accounted for the fact that the tenure of Mirza Hameedullah Beg started in the middle of a year (1973) and ended in the middle of a year (1985). This means that we need to adjust the number of days in the tenure accordingly.\n\nThe tenure started on 1 January 1973 and ended on 31 December 1985, which is a total of 12 years and 12 months. Since each year has 365 days and each month has approximately 30 days, the total number of days in the tenure can be estimated as 12 * 365 + 12 * 30 = 4380 + 360 = 4740 days.\n\nHowever, this estimate is still greater than the actual number of days in the tenure (3650 days). This indicates that we have made another mistake in our calculations.\n\nUpon reexamination, we realize that we have not accounted for the fact that the tenure of Mirza Hameedullah Beg started in the middle of a year",

            "content": " Mirza Hameedullah Beg served as the Chief Justice of India from 1973 to 1985. To find the length of his tenure in years and days, we need to subtract the start and end dates.\n\nThe start date is 1 January 1973 and the end date is 31 December 1985.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of years: 1985 - 1973 = 12 years.\n\nNow, let's find the number of days. We need to count the number of days from 1 January 1973 to 31 December 1985.\n\nFrom 1 January 1973 to 31 December 1973 (the last year of the tenure): 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1974 to 31 December 1974: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1975 to 31 December 1975: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1976 to 31 December 1976: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1977: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1978 to 31 December 1978: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1979: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1980 to 31 December 1980: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1981: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1982: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1983 to 31 December 1983: 365 days.\n\nFrom 1 January 1984 to 31 December 1984: 365 days.\n\nAdding these up, we get a total of 3650 days.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of days in the 12 years from the total number of days. Since each year has 365 days, the total number of days in 12 years is 12 * 365 = 4380 days.\n\nSo, the number of days remaining is 3650 - 4380 = -730 days.\n\nHowever, this result is negative, which means we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and find the error.\n\nUpon reexamination, we realize that we have not accounted for the leap year of 1984, which has 366 days. Let's correct this.\n\nThe total number of days in 12 years (including the leap year of 1984) is 12 * 365 + 366 = 4386 days.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of days remaining: 3650 - 4386 = -736 days.\n\nAgain, this result is negative, which indicates that we have made another mistake. Let's reexamine our calculations once more.\n\nUpon reexamination, we realize that we have not accounted for the fact that the tenure of Mirza Hameedullah Beg started in the middle of a year (1973) and ended in the middle of a year (1985).
