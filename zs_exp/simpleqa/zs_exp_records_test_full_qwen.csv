To find out how many Earth hours, minutes, and seconds are equivalent to a Martian sol, we need to convert 39 minutes and 35.244 seconds into their Earth time equivalents.

First, let's convert 39 minutes into hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes:
\[ 39 \text{ minutes} = \frac{39}{60} \text{ hours} \approx 0.65 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's convert 35.244 seconds into minutes and seconds. Since 1 minute = 60 seconds:
\[ 35.244 \text{ seconds} = 0.5874 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 0.5874 \text{ minutes} = 0 \text{ minutes} \text{ and } 35.244 \text{ seconds} \]

Adding these together, the total time in Earth hours, minutes, and seconds is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 0.65 \text{ hours} + 0 \text{ minutes} + 35.244 \text{ seconds} = 24.65 \text{ hours}, 0 \text{ minutes}, 35.244 \text{ seconds} \]
