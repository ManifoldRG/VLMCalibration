Verily, this (i.e., Allah's Obedience) is the path of the Lord (to Him) belongs the East and the West; therefore turn you (your face) in that direction. Lo, the path of Allah is straight. Lo, thus have We made of you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you; and We appointed the Qiblah (prayer direction) to which thou (O Muhammad) wert used (at Makkah) only that We might distinguish the people who follow the messenger from those who turn back on their heels (from faith). And it is He Who has sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, to make it prevail over all religions even though the idolaters may resent (it). Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are strong against unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou (O Muhammad) see them bowing, falling down prostrate, seeking bounty from Allah and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their faces (being) the trace of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah; and their likeness in the Gospel is that of a seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong; it grows thick and grows well and stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that with it they may enrage the disbelievers. Allah has promised those of them who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward. And be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into discord after receiving clear proofs; on them is a great Calamity. On the Day when faces shall be whitened and faces shall be blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened, it shall be said unto them: Disbelieve ye after your belief? Then taste the torment for that ye disbelieved. But as for those whose faces have been whitened, they shall be in Allah's mercy, they shall abide therein for ever. These are the verses of Allah which We recite unto thee (Muhammad) in truth; and Allah willeth no injustice to (His) slaves. And unto every one have We appointed a divine mission. And unto some of them have We given the knowledge of the interpretation of the signs, and some of them have We endowed with a tongue of truth for to speak with justice. And We have sent down unto thee (Muhammad) the Book with the truth, confirming what was before it of the Book and as a watcher over it. So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from some of that which Allah hath sent down unto thee. And if they turn away, then know that Allah is My protector, and lo! He is the best of the protectors. Who doth more wrong than he who forges a lie against Allah, or says: I have brought the Truth from Allah, when in truth he hath no truth in him? Is there not a (reward) for good (deeds) in the Hereafter? And yet they are hastening thereunto. Is not Hell (fire) a place of torment, an abode for the unbelievers? And they ask thee to hasten on the torment. Had it not been for a term appointed, the torment would have come upon them; and verily it will come upon them of a sudden, while they perceive not. And verily they ask thee to hasten on the torment, and lo! Hell, that they are hastening towards, is a place of torment. It is a return to thy Lord, and to thy Lord is the return. Then is it that they who do wrong will take thee for a friend, and Allah is a friend to those who guard (against evil)? Say: O my people! Do whatever ye can. Lo! I (too) am doing (my duty).
