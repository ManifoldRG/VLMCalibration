His tenure began on 15 August 1968 and ended on 24 February 1973.\n\nLet's calculate the duration:\n\n- From 15 August 1968 to 24 February 1973:\n  - 1968: 24 February is 180 days after 15 August (since 15 August is day 1).\n  - 1973: 24 February is 180 days after 15 August (same calculation as above).\n\nSo, the total number of days is 180 + 180 = 360 days.\n\nNow, converting 360 days into years and days:\n- 360 days is exactly 1 year and 0 days.\n\nTherefore, Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati's tenure as the Chief Justice of India was 1 year and 0 days.\n\nThe answer is: 1 year and 0 days.",
