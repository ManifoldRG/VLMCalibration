    "response": "The act referred to as the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was introduced in the Senate by Senator James A. Bayard from Delaware. However, it's important to note that this act was part of a larger legislative effort that culminated in the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the Compromise of 1850, which included provisions related to the importation of slaves but did not outright ban it. The actual prohibition of the importation of slaves was addressed earlier under the Second Congress with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 and more definitively with the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, which took effect in 1808.\n\nFor the specific act that directly prohibited the importation of slaves, it was signed into law on March 2, 1807, and took effect January 1, 1808, based on the Constitutional provision allowing such legislation after 1808. This act was championed by various members of Congress, but a key figure in its passage was Federalist Congressman John Lowell of Massachusetts, who introduced the bill in the House of Representatives.\n\nTherefore, the direct introduction in the Senate for the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves is less straightforward, as it was a collaborative effort across both chambers. However, if we consider the broader context of the legislative process leading up to the effective ban, Senator James A. Bayard played a significant role in the Compromise of 1850, which indirectly addressed slave importation among other issues.\n\nThe answer is: James A. Bayard, though his role was more prominent in the Compromise of 1850 rather than the direct Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves passed in 1807. For the specific act, the initiative came from Congressman John Lowell in the House of Representatives.",
