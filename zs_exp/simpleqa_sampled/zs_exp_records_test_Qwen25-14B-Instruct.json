    "response": "To find the Pinyin name of the Mansion that comes after \u6597 (D\u01d2u) within the Black Tortoise, we need to refer to the Chinese constellations known as the Twenty-eight Mansions or Xiu. The Black Tortoise (Xuan Wu) is one of the four symbols in Chinese astrology and contains seven mansions.\n\nThe sequence of the mansions in the Black Tortoise is:\n1. \u6634 (M\u01ceo)\n2. \u7562 (B\u00ec)\n3. \ufffd\u721f (Gu\u00e0n)\n4. \u9cf3 (F\u00e8ng)\n5. \u5371 (W\u0113i)\n6. \u865b (X\u016b)\n7. \u6597 (D\u01d2u)\n\nThe mansion immediately following \u6597 (D\u01d2u) does not exist in this sequence because D\u01d2u is the last mansion in the Black Tortoise. However, if we consider the next mansion in the overall sequence of the Twenty-eight Mansions, it would be part of the next symbol, the Green Dragon (Qing Long).\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the question might be asking for the next mansion in the overall sequence of the Twenty-eight Mansions, which is:\n\n\u6597 (D\u01d2u) in the Black Tortoise is followed by \u89d2 (Ji\u01ceo) in the Green Dragon.\n\nThe Pinyin name of \u89d2 (Ji\u01ceo) is Ji\u01ceo.\n\nThe answer is: Ji\u01ceo",

    "response": "To find the correct year when Henry Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne, succeeded his elder brother to the family estates, we need to look into historical records. Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, who later became the 1st Marquess of Lansdowne (and not the 1st Earl of Shelburne), succeeded his elder brother William Petty-Fitzmaurice, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, upon his death in 1761. However, the specific title mentioned in the question, 1st Earl of Shelburne, was actually held by his elder brother, not himself. Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice became the 3rd Earl of Shelburne after his father's death in 1764, but he did not succeed an elder brother for this title. The confusion arises from the different titles and succession within the family. Given the context of the question, it seems there might be a mix-up in the title or the person referred to.

However, the question specifies a French collaborator, so we must look further into Moissan's early collaborations within France.\n\nUpon closer examination, it becomes evident that Moissan's first scientific paper was actually co-authored with Charles Danjon, a French plant physiologist.

    "response": "To answer this question accurately, we need to identify the specific individual referred to as \"Anant Maral Shastri\" and his cellmates during his time in Patna jail. However, there seems to be some confusion or lack of clarity regarding the exact identity of \"Anant Maral Shastri,\" as this name does not correspond directly to any widely known historical figure associated with the Indian National Congress presidency.\n\nIf we assume that the question refers to someone who was imprisoned in Patna jail and later became the president of the Indian National Congress, one prominent figure who fits this description is K. Kamraj, who served as the President of the Indian National Congress from 1963 to 1966.

He was imprisoned in various places including Ahmednagar Fort, but not specifically in Patna jail.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the provided information, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact individual and their cellmates in Patna jail.
