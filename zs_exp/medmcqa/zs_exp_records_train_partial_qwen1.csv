21,Chronic urethral obstruction due to benign prismatic hyperplasia can lead to the following change in kidney parenchyma,"['Hyperplasia', 'Hyperophy', 'Atrophy', 'Dyplasia']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given condition and its effects on the kidney parenchyma.

Chronic urethral obstruction due to benign prismatic hyperplasia can cause a significant increase in pressure within the urinary tract. This increased pressure can lead to a condition known as hydronephrosis, where the kidneys become enlarged due to the accumulation of urine. Over time, this chronic backpressure can impair the renal function and lead to a reduction in the size and function of the kidney, a process known as atrophy.

Hyperplasia (A) refers to an increase in the number of cells, typically in response to inflammation or injury.
Hyperophy (B) is not a standard term in medical nomenclature. It might be a misspelling of ""hypertrophy,"" which means an increase in the size of cells, tissues, or organs.
Atrophy (C) refers to a decrease in the size of cells, tissues, or organs, which is consistent with the effects of chronic pressure on the kidneys.
Dyplasia (D) is a misspelling of ""dysplasia,"" which refers to abnormal development or growth of cells.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is C, as atrophy is the result of chronic pressure on the kidneys due to urethral obstruction.

A. Hemodialysis: While very effective at removing potassium, it has a slower onset of action compared to other options since it requires the blood to pass through an artificial filter. It typically takes several hours to reduce serum potassium levels significantly.

B. Sodium bicarbonate infusion: This can shift potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, but its effect is relatively slow as it depends on the kidneys to excrete the bicarbonate. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes to start lowering potassium levels.

C. Insulin and glucose infusion: Insulin helps shift potassium into cells when given with glucose. The onset of action is relatively rapid, typically within 10-15 minutes, making it one of the fastest options.

D. Intravenous calcium gluconate: This treatment helps prevent the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart by stabilizing the heart's cell membranes. It does not directly lower potassium levels but can help stabilize the heart rhythm. Its action is not as rapid in terms of lowering potassium as the other options.

57,In chronic alcoholism the rate limiting component for alcohol metabolism excluding enzymes is/are : (PGI Dec 2008),"['NADP', 'NAD+', 'NADPH', 'FADH']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the metabolic pathway of alcohol in the body. Alcohol metabolism primarily occurs in the liver, where it is broken down through two main pathways: the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS) and the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) pathway.

In the ADH pathway, alcohol is first converted to acetaldehyde, which is then further metabolized to acetate. This process relies on the enzyme ADH, which uses NAD+ as a coenzyme.

The rate-limiting step in this process is not the enzyme itself but the availability of NAD+, as it is consumed in the reaction and needs to be regenerated. The regeneration of NAD+ is critical because the availability of NAD+ can limit the rate of alcohol metabolism.

Let's analyze the options:

A. NADP - This is a reduced form of NAD and is not directly involved in the NAD+-dependent alcohol metabolism pathway.
B. NAD+ - This is the direct coenzyme involved in the alcohol dehydrogenase reaction.
C. NADPH - This is a reduced form of NADP and is not directly involved in the NAD+-dependent alcohol metabolism pathway.
D. FADH - This is a coenzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and not in alcohol metabolism.

60,Gp2b3A inhibitors are all except -,"['Abciximab', 'Eptifibatide', 'Tirofiban', 'Prasugrel']","To determine which option does not belong to the category of GP2b/3a inhibitors, we need to identify the mechanism of action and classification of each drug.

- **Abciximab** is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, inhibiting platelet aggregation.
- **Eptifibatide** is a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist that inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the release of thromboxane A2.
- **Tirofiban** is a direct GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor that prevents the interaction of fibrinogen with the GP IIb/IIIa receptor on the platelet surface.
- **Prasugrel** is a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, similar to eptifibatide, but it also has anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effects.

Based on the definitions, both eptifibatide and tirofiban are direct GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, while abciximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the same receptor. Prasugrel, however, is primarily an antiplatelet agent that targets the thromboxane A2 receptor rather than the GP IIb/IIIa receptor directly.

61,Which of the following is very difficult to induce antibody -,"['Polysaccharide', 'Protein', 'Antigen', 'Effector']","To determine which of the given options is very difficult to induce antibodies, we need to consider the immunogenicity of different types of molecules. 

- **Polysaccharides (A)**: These are complex carbohydrate structures. They are less immunogenic compared to proteins because they typically do not have T-cell epitopes, which are crucial for the initiation of the adaptive immune response.

- **Proteins (B)**: Proteins are generally highly immunogenic and can easily induce both humoral (antibody) and cellular (T-cell) immune responses.

- **Antigen (C)**: Antigen is a general term used to describe any substance that can be recognized by the immune system and elicit an immune response. Both proteins and polysaccharides can act as antigens, but the term itself does not specify the difficulty of inducing antibodies.

- **Effector (D)**: This term refers to components of the immune system that directly combat pathogens, such as antibodies, T-cells, and phagocytes. It does not refer to a type of molecule that can be induced to produce antibodies.

Given the above points, polysaccharides are much harder to induce antibodies against compared to proteins.

62,Position of limb in posterior dislocation of hip -,"['Flexion, abduction & external rotation', 'Flexion, adduction & internal rotation', 'Flexion, adduction & external rotation', 'Flexion, abduction & internal rotation']","To determine the correct position of the limb in a posterior dislocation of the hip, let's review the typical anatomy and mechanics of hip joint dislocation.

1. **Normal Hip Position**: In a normal, anatomically aligned hip, the femoral head is centered in the acetabulum, and the limb is usually in a position of:
   - Flexion (the knee is bent)
   - Adduction (the leg is drawn towards the midline of the body)
   - Internal rotation (the foot and leg point inward towards the other leg)

2. **Posterior Dislocation**: In a posterior dislocation, the femoral head moves behind the acetabulum. This changes the position of the limb as follows:
   - The limb remains flexed due to the position of the knee.
   - Due to the dislocation, the limb is also adducted (moved towards the midline of the body).
   - The internal rotation is maintained because the dislocation does not typically cause significant change in the rotational alignment, but the overall position is altered due to the posterior displacement.

A. Megaloblastic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by the production of abnormally large red blood cells. While it can lead to anemia, it is not typically associated with splenomegaly.

B. Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that causes red blood cells to become sickle-shaped, leading to chronic hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). This condition often results in a compensatory increase in red blood cell production and can lead to splenomegaly due to the increased number of sickle cells and the spleen's efforts to remove these abnormal cells.

C. Thalassemia is another genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, leading to anemia. While it can cause splenomegaly, it is less commonly associated with it compared to sickle cell anemia.

D. G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition that affects the red blood cells' ability to protect themselves from oxidative damage. It can cause acute hemolysis in response to certain triggers but is not typically associated with chronic splenomegaly.

Considering these points, the most common cause of splenomegaly among the given options is sickle cell anemia.

85,What is the pressure of inspiration?,"['Intrapleuarl', 'Transpulmonary', 'Trans chest wall', 'Alveolar pressure']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what ""pressure of inspiration"" refers to. Inspiration, or inhalation, involves the movement of air into the lungs due to a pressure gradient. The pressure of inspiration is the difference between the pressure within the lungs (alveolar pressure) and the pressure in the pleural space (intrapleural pressure).

- A. Intrapleural: This refers to the pressure within the pleural cavity, which is normally sub-atmospheric (negative) during inspiration.
- B. Transpulmonary: This term refers to the pressure difference across the lung itself, which is the difference between intrapleural pressure and alveolar pressure.
- C. Trans chest wall: This refers to the pressure difference across the chest wall, not directly related to the pressure within the lungs or the pleural space.
- D. Alveolar pressure: This is the pressure within the alveoli, which is influenced by the pressure in the pleural cavity during inspiration.

The pressure gradient that drives inspiration is the difference between the intrapleural pressure and the alveolar pressure. Therefore, the pressure of inspiration is best described by the term ""transpulmonary pressure,"" which is the difference between these two pressures.

86,"In caloric test, cold water stimulation causes movement of eye -","['Some side', 'Opposite side', 'Up', 'Do\\vn']","To reason through this, we need to understand the caloric test, which is used to evaluate the function of the vestibular system in the inner ear. During the test, cold or warm water is introduced into one external auditory canal. The cold or warm water stimulates the vestibular system, causing nystagmus (repetitive eye movements).

When cold water is introduced into the ear, it stimulates the lateral semicircular canal, which is responsible for detecting horizontal movements. This stimulation causes the eyes to move in a quick phase toward the stimulated ear (known as a fast phase) and then move slowly in the opposite direction. This pattern is known as nystagmus.

Given this information, cold water stimulation causes movement of the eye toward the same side as the stimulated ear, which is the opposite side from where the nystagmus is observed.

93,Which of the following hormonal activity is expected immediately prior to Ovulation?,"['LH surge', 'FSH surge', 'Progestrone surge', 'Estrogen surge']","To determine the correct answer, let's review the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle, specifically focusing on the time period immediately before ovulation.

- **Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**: This hormone triggers ovulation. Just before ovulation, there is a significant surge in LH levels, which causes the ovarian follicle to release the egg.
- **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**: This hormone stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles, but its levels peak earlier in the cycle, not immediately before ovulation.
- **Progestrone**: Progestrone levels rise after ovulation, specifically after the corpus luteum forms. It is not a major player in the immediate period before ovulation.
- **Estrogen**: Estrogen levels rise throughout the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and peak just before ovulation, but it is not the primary hormone associated with the immediate trigger of ovulation.

Given this information, the hormonal activity that is expected immediately prior to ovulation is the LH surge.

Her CPK level is also raised (500IU/L). She is probably suffering from?","['Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy', 'Becker muscular dystrophy', 'Limb-girdle dystrophy', 'Scapulofaciohumeral dystrophy']","Let's reason through the symptoms and test results to determine the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Quadriparesis**: This indicates muscle weakness in all four limbs.
2. **Facial palsy**: This suggests weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles.
3. **Winging of scapula**: This is a characteristic sign of muscle weakness in the serratus anterior muscle, which is often seen in neuromuscular conditions.
4. **Ptosis**: This is drooping of the upper eyelid, which can be a sign of muscle weakness, often related to the oculopharyngeal muscles.
5. **Family history of similar illness in father and brother**: This indicates a possible genetic condition.
6. **Raised CPK level (500 IU/L)**: Creatine kinase isoenzyme elevation is commonly seen in muscular dystrophies and other muscle diseases.

Now, let's consider each option:

- **Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy** typically presents with calf hypertrophy, contractures, and cardiac involvement, which are not the primary features in this case.
- **Becker muscular dystrophy** also involves skeletal muscle weakness but usually presents with more proximal muscle weakness, less facial and scapular involvement, and typically does not show facial palsy and ptosis.
- **Limb-girdle dystrophy** involves weakness in the proximal muscles of the limbs and can present with various features including facial palsy and winged scapula. It is a genetic condition that fits the family history and clinical presentation.
- **Scapulofaciohumeral dystrophy** (also known as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) typically presents with ptosis and facial weakness but usually does not involve quadriparesis or winged scapula to the extent described.

Given the combination of symptoms and the family history, the most likely diagnosis is **Limb-girdle dystrophy**.

99,IgA deposits on skin biopsy,"['Henoch Schouleiln puspura', 'Giant cell aeritis', 'Microscopic polyangitis', ""Wegener's granulomatosis""]","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to IgA deposits on a skin biopsy:

A. Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) - This is a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects children and is characterized by a triad of symptoms: purpura, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. Skin involvement in HSP often includes palpable purpura, and a skin biopsy may show IgA deposits, which is a hallmark feature of the disease.

B. Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) - This condition primarily affects the large and medium-sized arteries, particularly the temporal arteries. It does not typically present with IgA deposits in the skin.

C. Microscopic Polyangitis - This is a type of vasculitis that can involve small blood vessels and can affect the skin. However, the presence of IgA deposits is not a typical feature in microscopic polyangitis.

D. Wegener's Granulomatosis (now known as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) - This condition primarily involves the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys. While it can affect the skin, the characteristic deposits in the skin are not typically IgA but rather granulomas and necrotizing vasculitis.

A. ""ARI of 1% = 75 new cases"" - This statement is generally correct as it reflects the annual risk of infection (ARI) in a population. If the ARI is 1%, it means that 1% of the population would become infected with TB each year, and if we assume a population of 1000 people, it would translate to approximately 10 new infections, not 75. However, the context here might be different, but the given relationship (1% ARI = 75 new cases) is not accurate.

B. ""Current ARI in India is 1.7%"" - This statement is generally correct. India has a relatively high ARI, which reflects the high burden of TB in the country.

C. ""It represents new cases of TB"" - This statement is not accurate. The ARI represents the risk of infection, not the risk of developing active TB disease. New cases of TB are a different measure that includes both new and relapsed cases.

D. ""It is assessed by tuberculin conversion in previously non-vaccinated children"" - This statement is correct. The tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are used to measure tuberculin conversion, which helps in assessing the ARI in populations.

Given the analysis, the statement that is not false but is actually incorrect is C. The ARI does not represent new cases of TB but represents the risk of infection.

Cultures of the lower lobe of the left lung would most likely reveal which organism?","['Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa']","To determine the most likely organism that would be revealed by cultures of the lower lobe of the left lung, let's consider the clinical presentation and the imaging findings.

- The patient is a 12-year-old girl with fever, shortness of breath, and cough.
- A chest X-ray shows complete consolidation of the lower lobe of the left lung.

The symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with a pulmonary infection, specifically a lobar pneumonia. 

- **Streptococcus pneumoniae (A)**: This is a common cause of lobar pneumonia, especially in children. It often presents with symptoms like fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and chest X-rays can show consolidation in one lobe.
- **Staphylococcus aureus (B)**: This can also cause pneumonia, but it is more likely to cause more diffuse infiltrates or multiple lobar consolidations rather than complete consolidation of one lobe.
- **Klebsiella pneumoniae (C)**: This organism typically causes a more severe and often necrotizing form of pneumonia, sometimes referred to as ""acute lobar pneumonia,"" but it is less common in children.
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa (D)**: This is more commonly associated with lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or compromised immune systems, and it often causes more diffuse involvement rather than complete lobar consolidation.

Given the clinical presentation and the typical radiographic findings, the most likely organism to be cultured from the lower lobe of the left lung is **Streptococcus pneumoniae**.

The most likely diagnosis is:,"['Stafne’s bone cavity', 'Radicular Cyst', 'Dentigerous cyst', 'Lateral periodontal cyst']","To determine the correct diagnosis, we need to analyze the characteristics of the lesion shown in the radiograph.

1. **Stafne’s Bone Cavity (Option A)**: This condition is characterized by a radiolucent (dark) area in the angle of the mandible, typically associated with a bony defect without a lining cyst. It is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally.

2. **Radicular Cyst (Option B)**: This type of cyst is commonly associated with a tooth root, often seen as a round, unilocular radiolucent area surrounding the apex of a tooth. It is usually symptomatic, especially if the tooth is involved.

3. **Dentigerous Cyst (Option C)**: This cyst is associated with an unerupted or partially erupted tooth, typically seen as a radiolucent area around the crown of the tooth. It is usually symptomatic due to the impacted nature of the tooth.

4. **Lateral Periodontal Cyst (Option D)**: This cyst is typically seen as a well-defined, unilocular radiolucent lesion along the crest of the alveolar ridge, usually associated with a periodontal pocket. It is usually symptomatic due to the presence of a periodontal problem.

Given that the patient is asymptomatic and the lesion is an accidental finding, the most likely diagnosis is Stafne’s bone cavity, which is typically found without associated symptoms and is more often a incidental finding.

108,Increase in pauwel's angle indicate,"['Good prognosis', 'Impaction', 'More chances of displacement', 'Trabecular alignment displacement']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the meaning of Pauwel's angle in the context of maxillofacial and dental anatomy. Pauwel's angle is the angle formed between the long axis of the impacted tooth and the long axis of the adjacent, normally positioned tooth. An increase in Pauwel's angle generally indicates a more mesial (towards the midline of the face) position of the impacted tooth relative to the adjacent tooth, which can make it more difficult to extract or align properly, and increases the risk of displacement or impaction.

Given the options:
A. Good prognosis - This does not align with an increase in Pauwel's angle, as it suggests a favorable outcome, which is not indicated by a more mesially positioned impacted tooth.
B. Impaction - While an increase in Pauwel's angle can contribute to impaction, it is not the primary description of the angle itself.
C. More chances of displacement - This aligns well with the increased risk of the impacted tooth moving due to its mesial position.
D. Trabecular alignment displacement - This is not a standard term in the context of Pauwel's angle and does not directly relate to the angle's implications.

The most accurate description of an increase in Pauwel's angle is that it indicates a higher chance of displacement.

B. Japanese encephalitis - This disease is transmitted by mosquitoes (arthropods) from infected birds to humans. The cycle involves birds (as reservoir hosts), mosquitoes (as vectors), and then humans.

C. Paragonimus - This is a type of lung fluke that can be transmitted from infected animals (often wild mammals or birds) to humans through contaminated food. While arthropods can be involved in the life cycle of some related parasites, the primary transmission for Paragonimus does not involve a bird-to-human-to-arthropod-to-human chain.

D. Plague - This disease is primarily transmitted by fleas (arthropods) that have bitten infected rodents. While birds can be involved in the spread of the plague, it is not a primary part of the transmission chain for human infections.

Given the transmission chains:
- Malaria involves humans and mosquitoes but not birds.
- Japanese encephalitis involves birds, mosquitoes, and humans.
- Paragonimus involves humans and possibly birds, but not in a chain involving mosquitoes.
- Plague involves rodents and fleas, but not birds in the human transmission.

121,Which of the following is a poor prognostic factor for childhood ALL.,"['Total Leukocyte count 4000-100,000', 'Age < 2 years', 'Testicular involvement', 'Blasts in peripheral smear']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):

A. Total Leukocyte count 4000-100,000: A high total leukocyte count (often referred to as a ""blast count"") can be indicative of more aggressive disease, but a count in this range (4000-100,000) is generally not considered as poor a prognostic factor as some other indicators.

B. Age < 2 years: Younger age at diagnosis is often associated with a poorer prognosis in childhood ALL. This is because very young children may have less mature immune systems and might not respond as well to the standard treatment protocols.

C. Testicular involvement: Testicular involvement is a known poor prognostic factor in childhood ALL. It suggests a more advanced stage of the disease and is associated with a higher risk of relapse.

D. Blasts in peripheral smear: The presence of blasts in the peripheral blood smear is a common finding in ALL and is used to diagnose the disease. However, its presence alone is not as strongly indicative of a poor prognosis compared to other factors like age or testicular involvement.

Considering the above points, the most definitive poor prognostic factors for childhood ALL are age less than 2 years and testicular involvement. However, between the two, testicular involvement is more strongly associated with a poor prognosis.

Which of the following thrombogenic processes involving platelets is most directly impaired?","['Adhesion', 'Aggregation', 'Formation of fibrinogen bridges', 'Conformational change with activation of phospholipid surface']","To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each option:

1. **Prolonged Bleeding Time and Normal Platelet Count**: This suggests that the issue is not with the number of platelets but with the function of the existing platelets.

2. **Easy Bleeding with Frequent Bleeding of the Gums, Epistaxis, Cutaneous Bleeding, and Menorrhagia**: These symptoms are consistent with a bleeding disorder affecting the ability of platelets to form a proper clot.

3. **Deficiency of Von Willebrand Factor (vWF)**: Von Willebrand factor is crucial for platelet adhesion to the blood vessel wall. It also carries factor VIII and helps in the formation of platelet plugs. A deficiency in vWF would primarily affect the adhesion of platelets.

Now, let's analyze each option:

- **A. Adhesion**: Von Willebrand factor is directly involved in the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelial matrix of the blood vessel. Therefore, a deficiency in vWF would impair this process.

- **B. Aggregation**: This involves the clustering of platelets in response to an activated platelet surface. While vWF does play a role in aggregation indirectly, it is more directly involved in adhesion.

- **C. Formation of Fibrinogen Bridges**: This process involves the cross-linking of fibrin to form a stable clot, which is more related to the function of coagulation factors and is not directly impaired by a deficiency in vWF.

- **D. Conformational Change with Activation of Phospholipid Surface**: This refers to the activation of the platelet surface to form a procoagulant surface. This process is more related to the activation of platelets rather than their adhesion or aggregation.

Given the information, the most directly impaired process due to the deficiency of Von Willebrand factor is adhesion.

145,Coloured urine is not seen in :,"['Quinine', 'Rifampcin', 'Nitrofurantoin', 'Pyridium']","To determine which of the options does not cause colored urine, let's review the effects of each medication on urine color:

- **Quinine**: This medication can cause urine to appear green or yellow-green due to its color.
- **Rifampcin**: This antibiotic commonly causes urine, sweat, and saliva to appear orange or red.
- **Nitrofurantoin**: This antibiotic can cause urine to turn a dark brown or orange color.
- **Pyridium**: This medication, used for treating urinary tract irritation, can cause urine to appear dark yellow or orange.

Based on the above information, none of the medications listed are known to cause a lack of colored urine. However, the question asks for the medication that does **not** cause colored urine, and all the medications listed do cause some form of colored urine. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the options based on the context of the question.

Since the question is framed to identify the medication that does **not** cause colored urine, and all the options cause some form of colored urine, the correct answer would be the one that does not fit this pattern. Given the context, the question might be misstated, but based on the provided options and their known effects, all cause some form of urine color change.

A. Choroid plexus cyst: While choroid plexus cysts are relatively common and do not necessarily indicate aneuploidy, they can be associated with certain chromosomal abnormalities, particularly trisomy 18. However, their presence alone is not a strong indicator of aneuploidy.

B. Nuchal translucency: This is a measurement of the clear space at the back of the fetus's neck. Increased nuchal translucency is one of the strongest prenatal ultrasound markers for chromosomal abnormalities, particularly trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). It is often used in conjunction with other markers to assess risk.

C. Cystic hygroma: This is a lymphatic malformation and is more commonly associated with chromosomal syndromes such as Turner syndrome, rather than aneuploidy in general.

D. Single umbilical artery: A single umbilical artery can be present in normal pregnancies, but it is more frequently observed in pregnancies complicated by chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 21.

Considering the above information, the nuchal translucency measurement, which is specifically associated with chromosomal abnormalities and aneuploidy, has the highest association.

Which of the following valvular hea lesion can be suspected-","['antral stenosis', 'Tricuspid regurgitation', 'Aoic stenosis', 'Aoic regurgitation']","To determine the correct valvular heart lesion, let's analyze the symptoms and their correlation with different valvular conditions:

1. **Angina**: This is typically associated with coronary artery disease or aortic stenosis (AS), as AS can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and subsequent myocardial ischemia.
2. **Syncope**: This can be caused by reduced cardiac output, which is more commonly seen in AS where the systolic pressure gradient is high, leading to a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing or during exertion.
3. **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**: CHF can be a consequence of any valvular disease that leads to left ventricular dysfunction, but aortic stenosis is a common cause of systolic dysfunction and subsequent CHF.

Given these points, aortic stenosis (AS) is the most likely valvular heart lesion that would present with all three symptoms: angina, syncope, and CHF.

165,High false positive cases in a community signify that disease has -,"['High prevalence & Low incidence', 'High incidence & Low prevalence', 'Low prevalence & Low incidence', 'High incidence & High prevalence']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the definitions and implications of prevalence and incidence:

- **Prevalence** is the number of existing cases of a disease in a given population at a specific time.
- **Incidence** is the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specific period.

A high false positive rate in a community means that many people who do not have the disease are being incorrectly identified as having it. This is more likely to occur in a population with low prevalence, where the actual number of true cases is small. Since a high false positive rate is associated with a large number of negative cases incorrectly classified as positive, this suggests that the overall number of cases (both true and false) is high relative to the population size, implying low prevalence.

However, a high false positive rate can also be indicative of a disease that is spreading quickly, leading to a higher incidence. This is because if a disease is spreading rapidly, there will be more new cases appearing, which can lead to a higher number of false positives if the test is not perfectly sensitive or specific.

Given these points, high false positive cases suggest a low prevalence (since there are relatively few true cases overall) but also a high incidence (since the number of new cases is high, leading to more positives, some of which are false).

A. Orexin: Orexin is actually produced in the lateral hypothalamus, but it is more specifically associated with the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). However, orexin is not primarily known as a hypothalamic hormone but rather as a neurotransmitter.

B. Cortisol releasing hormone: This hormone is indeed released from the hypothalamus. It is called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol.

C. Neuropeptide: This term is too broad and not specific to any particular hypothalamic hormone. Neuropeptides are a class of proteins that act as neurotransmitters or hormones, but the term itself does not identify a specific hormone released from the hypothalamus.

D. Ghrelin: Ghrelin is primarily produced in the stomach and is involved in regulating appetite, but it is also produced in the hypothalamus and other areas. However, it is not the primary hormone released from the hypothalamus.

Given this analysis, the hormone specifically known to be released from the hypothalamus is Cortisol releasing hormone (CRH).

172,"Following death of a person, what happens to potassium level in the vitreous.","['Potassium level falls', 'Potassium level increases', 'Remains unchanged', 'It depends on cause of death']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the biological changes that occur after death. Following death, the body undergoes a process called autolysis, where cells start to break down due to the depletion of ATP and other metabolic factors. This breakdown releases various substances, including potassium, from the cells into the extracellular space.

The vitreous humor, which is the gel-like substance that fills the eyeball, can absorb some of these released substances. Therefore, the potassium level in the vitreous humor would likely increase as a result of the cellular breakdown.

173,Which test helps to differentiate between concomitant squint and paralytic squint,"['Cover - uncover test', 'Alternate covertest', 'Direct cover test', 'None of the above']","To differentiate between concomitant squint (where the misalignment of the eyes occurs in all directions of gaze) and paralytic squint (where the misalignment is in a particular direction and is due to a weakness of a specific eye muscle), the most appropriate test is the cover-uncover test. This test helps to determine if the misalignment is fixed (indicative of a paralytic squint) or if it varies with gaze (indicative of a concomitant squint).

The cover-uncover test involves covering one eye to see the movement of the uncovered eye, then uncovering it and covering the other eye to observe the movement. This helps in assessing the fixation and the movement of the eyes.

The alternate cover test is another useful test, but it is typically used to assess for manifest strabismus and does not specifically differentiate between concomitant and paralytic squints as effectively as the cover-uncover test does.

The direct cover test is used to identify the direction of strabismus but does not help differentiate between concomitant and paralytic squints.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

   B. Lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that originates in lymphocytes. While lymphoma can cause lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), it is not typically associated with calcification.
   
   C. Sarcoidosis: This is a disease characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small, inflammatory tissue nodules, in various organs. Sarcoidosis frequently involves the mediastinal lymph nodes, and calcification is a common finding in these nodes.
   
   D. Bronchiectasis: This condition involves the abnormal, permanent enlargement of parts of the airways. While it can cause changes in the lymph nodes, it is not specifically associated with calcification of mediastinal lymph nodes.

Given this reasoning, the most appropriate answer is C. Sarcoidosis.

206,In a 24 year old man weight of the upper limb is transmitted to the axial skeleton by:,"['Coracoacromial ligament', 'Coracoclavicular ligament', 'Costoclavicular ligament', 'Coracohumeral ligament']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the path of the force transmission from the upper limb to the axial skeleton. The upper limb is primarily connected to the axial skeleton through the shoulder girdle, which consists of the clavicle (collarbone) and scapula (shoulder blade).

The coracoacromial ligament (A) is part of the shoulder girdle, connecting the coracoid process of the scapula to the acromion, but it does not directly transmit weight to the axial skeleton.

The coracoclavicular ligament (B) connects the coracoid process of the scapula to the clavicle, playing a role in stabilizing the clavicle but not directly in transmitting weight to the axial skeleton.

The costoclavicular ligament (C) connects the clavicle to the first rib, which is part of the axial skeleton. This ligament supports the clavicle but is not the primary structure for transmitting the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.

The coracohumeral ligament (D) is located between the coracoid process of the scapula and the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus. This ligament does not play a role in transmitting weight to the axial skeleton.

The primary structure that transmits the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton is the clavicle. The clavicle connects the shoulder girdle to the axial skeleton, and the coracoclavicular ligament and sternoclavicular joint work together to transmit the weight.

207,Supraventricular crest lies between-,"['Pulmonary orifice and atrioventricular orifice', 'Atrioventricular orifice and fossa ovalis', 'SVC and right atrium', 'Right an dleft coronary artery']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down each option in the context of cardiac anatomy:

A. Pulmonary orifice and atrioventricular orifice: The supraventricular crest is a landmark in the right atrium that separates the superior vena cava (SVC) and the inferior vena cava (IVC) orifices from the atrioventricular orifice (orifice of the right atrioventricular valve, also known as the tricuspid valve). However, this option does not directly mention the SVC, which is a key component.

B. Atrioventricular orifice and fossa ovalis: The atrioventricular orifice is the opening of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, and the fossa ovalis is a remnant of the fetal foramen ovale in the interventricular septum. The supraventricular crest is not located between these two structures.

C. SVC and right atrium: The superior vena cava (SVC) orifice is indeed located in the supraventricular crest, which is a boundary in the right atrium that separates the SVC and IVC orifices from the atrioventricular orifice. This option correctly identifies the location.

D. Right and left coronary artery: The coronary arteries are not directly related to the supraventricular crest's location in the right atrium.

Considering the anatomical location and the correct identification of the structures, the correct answer is:

208,Shock causes:,"['Stagnant hypoxia', 'Anemic hypoxia', 'Hypoxic hypoxia', 'Histotoxic hypoxia']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the nature of shock and how it affects oxygenation in the body.

1. **Stagnant Hypoxia (Option A)**: This occurs when blood flow is reduced, but the hemoglobin is still oxygenated. Shock typically leads to reduced blood flow and can cause stagnant hypoxia, but it is not the primary type of hypoxia associated with shock.

2. **Anemic Hypoxia (Option B)**: This is a condition where there is a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood due to a reduction in red blood cells or hemoglobin. Shock does not directly cause anemia, so this is not the primary mechanism involved in shock.

3. **Hypoxic Hypoxia (Option C)**: This type of hypoxia occurs when the oxygen partial pressure in the alveoli is too low, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues. Shock can cause hypoxic hypoxia by reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues, making this a strong candidate.

4. **Histotoxic Hypoxia (Option D)**: This occurs when the tissues are unable to use the oxygen that is available. Shock does not directly cause this type of hypoxia.

Given these explanations, hypoxic hypoxia is the primary mechanism by which shock causes tissue hypoxia.

209,Which of the following statements about Total Infra–Venous Anaesthesia (TIVA) is true –,"['Causes More Renal Toxicity', 'Reduces Cerebral Metabolic Rate', 'Risk of Malignant Hyperthermia is high', 'Inhibits Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasconstriction']","Let's analyze each option:

A. Causes More Renal Toxicity - General anesthesia, including TIVA, can potentially cause renal toxicity due to the metabolites of anesthetic agents and their effects on blood flow and metabolism. However, it is not inherently more toxic to the kidneys compared to other forms of anesthesia.

B. Reduces Cerebral Metabolic Rate - TIVA, which relies heavily on intravenous anesthetic agents such as propofol and opioids, can reduce cerebral metabolic rate. This is a known effect of these agents as they depress central nervous system activity.

C. Risk of Malignant Hyperthermia is high - Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but serious condition triggered by certain anesthetic agents and muscle relaxants. It is not typically associated with TIVA, as TIVA does not use halogenated agents that are the primary triggers for malignant hyperthermia.

D. Inhibits Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasconstriction - General anesthetics can affect pulmonary vasculature, but TIVA specifically does not inherently inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasconstriction. This effect would more likely be seen with inhaled agents.

After considering each option, the most accurate statement about TIVA is that it can reduce the cerebral metabolic rate.

210,One of the constituents of the commonly used metered dose inhalers in bronchial asthma which is an air pollutant & dangerous to earth's stratosphere is -,"['Flurocarbons', 'Salbutamol', 'Ozone', 'Oxygen']","Let's reason through each option:

A. Flurocarbons: These are commonly used as propellants in metered dose inhalers because they provide a quick release of the medication. However, they are also known to deplete the ozone layer in the earth's stratosphere, making them a significant air pollutant.

B. Salbutamol: This is a bronchodilator used in the treatment of bronchial asthma and other respiratory conditions. It is not a propellant and does not deplete the ozone layer.

C. Ozone: While ozone is a component of the stratosphere and is important for blocking harmful UV radiation, it is not a component of metered dose inhalers.

D. Oxygen: This is a component of air but is not used as a propellant in inhalers.

Based on the information provided, the correct answer is the one that is a propellant in inhalers and also a known air pollutant that affects the stratosphere.

211,Which of the following iodinated compound is present in a maximum concentration in the thyroid?,"['Monoiodotyrosine (MIT)', 'Diiodotyrosine (DIT)', 'T3', 'Reverse T3']","To answer this question, let's consider the formation and concentration of iodinated compounds in the thyroid gland:

1. **Monoiodotyrosine (MIT)**: This is the first product of iodine incorporation into tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin. It is present in small amounts because it is immediately converted to Diiodotyrosine (DIT).

2. **Diiodotyrosine (DIT)**: This is a key intermediate in the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). DIT is further converted to T3 and T4 by enzymatic processes. It is present in higher concentrations compared to MIT.

3. **T3**: This is a fully iodinated thyroid hormone. While it is produced by the conversion of DIT, it is stored in small quantities because the majority is secreted into the bloodstream for immediate use.

4. **Reverse T3 (rT3)**: This is a form of T3 that has decreased biological activity. It is not the primary form of iodinated thyroid hormone stored in the thyroid gland.

Given this information, Diiodotyrosine (DIT) is the compound present in the highest concentration in the thyroid due to its role in the synthesis pathway of T3 and T4.

212,You are the medical officer in charge of the immunisation programme at a sub-centre and you are informed by the local ASHA worker that one of the children who was immunised has has been dizzy. On fuher investigation it was confirmed that the symptoms were due to anxiety of pain of the injection and not as a result of the vaccine. You would consider the incidence as:,"['Vaccine reaction', 'Injection reaction', 'Programme error', 'Coincidental']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided:

1. The child experienced symptoms (dizziness) after receiving an immunisation.
2. Further investigation confirmed that the symptoms were due to anxiety or pain from the injection, not a reaction to the vaccine itself.

Given these points, the symptoms were not a result of the vaccine but rather a reaction to the process of receiving the injection. This rules out options A (Vaccine reaction) and C (Programme error).

Option B (Injection reaction) is closer to the correct answer but specifically refers to a reaction to the injection process, which in this case does not seem to be the cause of the symptoms.

Option D (Coincidental) best fits the scenario described. The dizziness could have been coincidental to the vaccination, as it was caused by anxiety or pain rather than the vaccine itself.

213,Which of the following drugs can be administered by subcutaneous route?,"['Albuterol', 'Metaproterenol', 'Terbutaline', 'Pirbuterol']","To determine which of these drugs can be administered by subcutaneous route, we need to consider the typical routes of administration for each drug. Albuterol, metaproterenol, terbutaline, and pirbuterol are all beta-agonists used for bronchodilation.

- Albuterol is commonly administered via inhalation (MDI or nebulizer) but can also be given intravenously or intramuscularly.
- Metaproterenol is usually administered via inhalation but can be given intravenously or intramuscularly.
- Terbutaline is typically given by inhalation or intravenous route and is less commonly used by the subcutaneous route.
- Pirbuterol is usually administered via inhalation or intravenous route and is not commonly used by the subcutaneous route.

However, among the options provided, terbutaline (C) is the one that is occasionally administered subcutaneously, though it is more commonly used via inhalation or intravenously.

Which of the following statements best describes the presence of the organism in tissue biopsies?","['Yeasts with broad-based bud', 'Single-cell yeasts with pseudohyphae', 'Arthrospores', 'Oval budding yeasts inside macrophages']","To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the characteristics of H. capsulatum, which is Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus that exists in two forms: yeast and mold. In the tissue biopsies of individuals who have contracted histoplasmosis, the organism typically appears as oval budding yeasts. This is a key characteristic that differentiates it from other fungi.

Let's evaluate each option:
- A. Yeasts with broad-based buds: While this could describe yeasts in some cases, it's not the most specific or accurate description for H. capsulatum.
- B. Single-cell yeasts with pseudohyphae: Pseudohyphae are not a characteristic of H. capsulatum; it typically does not form pseudohyphae.
- C. Arthrospores: Arthrospores are not the form in which H. capsulatum is typically found in tissue biopsies.
- D. Oval budding yeasts inside macrophages: This accurately describes the presence of H. capsulatum in tissue biopsies, as it frequently appears as budding yeasts within macrophages.

215,The retention of dowel in a pin retained crown is increased by,"['Increased length, smooth surface and increased taper.', 'Increased length, serrated surface and increased taper.', 'Increased length, smooth surface and parallel sides.', 'Increased length, serrated surface and parallel sides.']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each component of the options related to the retention of a dowel in a pin-retained crown:

1. **Increased Length**: This is a common factor in increasing retention as a longer dowel has more contact with the preparation, providing better resistance to dislodgement.

2. **Smooth Surface vs. Serrated Surface**:
   - **Smooth Surface**: Generally, a smooth surface provides uniform distribution of forces and can enhance retention.
   - **Serrated Surface**: Serrations can create additional interlocking points, which can significantly increase retention.

3. **Increased Taper**: A more tapered dowel creates a better fit with the preparation, enhancing retention.

4. **Parallel Sides**: This typically does not enhance retention in the same way that a smooth or serrated surface and taper do. Parallel sides are more related to fit and ease of insertion rather than retention.

Given these points, the option that best enhances retention by combining a long dowel with features that provide additional interlocking points and a good fit is:

**Increased length, serrated surface, and increased taper.**

216,True about polio:,"['Paralytic polio is most common', 'Spastic paralysis seen', 'IM injections and increased muscular activity lead to increased paralysis', 'Polio drops in pulse polio immunisation given only in <3 years old children']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A. Paralytic polio is most common.
- Paralytic polio is indeed the most common type of polio, affecting the motor neurons and causing muscle weakness or paralysis. Therefore, this statement is true.

B. Spastic paralysis seen.
- Spastic paralysis is a symptom of another condition, often associated with cerebral palsy or other neurological disorders. It is not typically a characteristic of polio. Polio can cause flaccid paralysis, not spastic paralysis.

C. IM injections and increased muscular activity lead to increased paralysis.
- This statement is incorrect. In fact, increased muscular activity can help prevent muscle atrophy and paralysis in polio patients. Immune responses to infections, not injections, can lead to paralysis.

D. Polio drops in pulse polio immunization given only in <3 years old children.
- Pulse polio immunization campaigns, such as the ""polio drops"" (oral polio vaccine), are typically given to children under five years of age, not just those under three years. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.

The most accurate statement is A.

217,Bacterial pyogenic parotitis affecting the parotid gland is most common after: March 2008,"['Uveo-parotid fever', 'Mumps', 'Debilitation after major surgery', 'After administration of iodine']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of bacterial pyogenic parotitis affecting the parotid gland:

A. Uveo-parotid fever: This is a complication of mumps, which can cause inflammation of the parotid gland, but it is not typically associated with bacterial pyogenic parotitis.

B. Mumps: Mumps is a viral infection that can cause parotid gland swelling, but it is not the primary cause of bacterial pyogenic parotitis.

C. Debilitation after major surgery: Patients who are debilitated after major surgery may have a compromised immune system, making them more susceptible to bacterial infections, including bacterial pyogenic parotitis.

D. After administration of iodine: Iodine administration is not typically linked to an increased risk of bacterial pyogenic parotitis.

Considering the context and the clinical scenario, debilitation after major surgery (option C) is the most plausible reason for bacterial pyogenic parotitis as it can lead to a weakened immune system, making the patient more susceptible to bacterial infections.

218,Budding reproduction in tissue is seen in,"['Cryptococcus, candida', 'Candida, rhizopus', 'Rhizopus, mucor', 'Histoplasma, candida']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what budding reproduction in tissue means. Budding is a type of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from the parent organism and eventually separates to become an independent entity. In the context of medical microbiology, budding is a characteristic feature of certain fungal species.

Let's analyze each option:

A. Cryptococcus, candida: Both Cryptococcus and Candida are fungi that reproduce by budding. Cryptococcus neoformans is a well-known example of a fungus that reproduces via budding.

B. Candida, rhizopus: Candida reproduces by budding, as mentioned earlier. Rhizopus, on the other hand, reproduces by sporangiospores, not by budding.

C. Rhizopus, mucor: These fungi reproduce by sporangiospores, not by budding.

D. Histoplasma, candida: Histoplasma reproduces by budding, and Candida also reproduces by budding. 

Since both Cryptococcus and Candida are correctly associated with budding, and Histoplasma is also correct, but the question asks for a pair, option A is the most accurate choice as it includes both Cryptococcus and Candida.

219,Mycosis fungoides which is not true:,"['It is the most common form of cutaneous lymphoma.', 'Pautriers microabscess.', 'Indolent course and easily amenable to treatment.', 'Erythroderma seen and spreads to peripheral.']","Let's analyze each option:

A. ""It is the most common form of cutaneous lymphoma."" - This is true. Mycosis fungoides is indeed the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

B. ""Pautriers microabscess."" - This is also true. Pautrier microabscesses are a characteristic finding in Mycosis fungoides, composed of atypical T cells within a neutrophilic background.

C. ""Indolent course and easily amenable to treatment."" - This statement is not entirely accurate. While Mycosis fungoides typically has an indolent course and can be managed with various treatments, it is not always ""easily amenable to treatment."" The effectiveness of treatment can vary widely depending on the stage and progression of the disease.

D. ""Erythroderma seen and spreads to peripheral."" - This is not true. Erythroderma (a widespread redness of the skin) is not a typical feature of Mycosis fungoides. The disease usually presents with patches or plaques and can spread, but erythroderma is not a common presentation.

221,Human development index includes -,"['Crude death rate', 'Life expectancy at one year', 'Life expectancy at bih', 'All']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the components of the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is a summary statistic of average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Specifically, it uses the following indicators:

1. **Life expectancy at birth** - This measures the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if current mortality patterns remain constant.
2. **Mean years of schooling** - This is the average number of years of schooling of adults aged 25 years and older.
3. **Expected years of schooling** - This is the average number of years of schooling that a child of school-entering age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of schooling duration and age-specific survival rates persist throughout the child’s lifetime.
4. **Gross national income per capita** - This measures the average income per person.

Among the given options:

- **A. Crude death rate** - This is not directly used in the HDI.
- **B. Life expectancy at one year** - This is not the standard measure used in the HDI; life expectancy at birth is used.
- **C. Life expectancy at birth** - This is the standard measure used in the HDI.
- **D. All** - This is not accurate because not all options are correct.

A. Can be diagnosed intrauterine: This is correct. ARPKD can often be detected before birth through prenatal ultrasound, which can show enlarged kidneys and other characteristic features.

B. Proceeds to renal failure till children reaches school going age: While ARPKD can lead to severe renal dysfunction, the progression to renal failure does not necessarily occur by the time a child reaches school age. It can vary widely depending on the severity.

C. Can be palpated abdominally: This is also correct. Infants with ARPKD often have large, palpable kidneys due to the cysts.

D. Hypertension doesn't develop until late stages of the disease: This is incorrect. Hypertension is a common feature in ARPKD and can develop early in the course of the disease, not just in late stages.

Given the analysis, the correct options are A and C. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, and both A and C are correct, we need to consider which is the most accurate in the context of the question, which seems to be asking for one primary feature.

- **Low grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (LSIL)**: This typically indicates a less severe and lower risk of progression to carcinoma.
- **High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL)**: This is a more severe form and has a higher risk of progressing to carcinoma compared to LSIL.
- **Squamous intraepithelial associated with HPV 16**: Human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) is strongly associated with a higher risk of progression to carcinoma. However, it does not specify the grade.
- **Squamous intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HIV**: HIV infection can increase the risk of progression to carcinoma, but it does not specify the grade.

Given these considerations, **High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL)** is the most specific term indicating a higher risk of progression to carcinoma compared to LSIL, and the additional factors like HPV 16 and HIV do not necessarily elevate the risk as much as the grade of the lesion.

1. **Caecum**: This is the first part of the large intestine and is a common starting point for colonoscopies. However, it is not typically the site of the most common perforation.

2. **Hepatic Flexure**: This is the area where the ascending colon bends toward the liver and is less commonly involved in perforations.

3. **Splenic Flexure**: This is the area where the descending colon bends away from the spleen. While it can be a site of perforation, it is not as common as the sigmoid colon.

4. **Sigmoid Colon**: This is the last part of the large intestine and is known to be the most common site of perforation during colonoscopy. This is often due to the anatomical structure and the length of this segment, which can make it more susceptible to damage during the procedure.

Given this information, the most common site of perforation during colonoscopy is the sigmoid colon.

She is unable to sit or walk because of unsteadiness. Over the next few hours, she develops a decline in her level of consciousness.For the above patient with altered level of consciousness, select the most likely diagnosis.","['basal ganglia hemorrhage', 'cerebellar hemorrhage', 'pontine hemorrhage', 'lobar intracerebral hemorrhage']","Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation to determine the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Symptoms:**
   - Occipital headache: This suggests a lesion affecting the occipital region of the brain.
   - Vomiting and dizziness: These are common symptoms associated with increased intracranial pressure and can be seen in various conditions such as hemorrhage.
   - Unsteadiness and inability to walk: This indicates a problem with balance and coordination, which can be caused by damage to the cerebellum.
   - Decline in level of consciousness: This suggests an increase in intracranial pressure or a lesion affecting the brainstem or upper brain structures.

2. **Clinical Findings:**
   - Blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg: This could be due to either the acute event (hemorrhage) or a secondary response to the condition.
   - Respirations of 30/min: This suggests a possible brainstem involvement or increased intracranial pressure leading to respiratory changes.

Given these symptoms, the most likely location of the hemorrhage is the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance, and its involvement would explain the unsteadiness and inability to walk. Additionally, cerebellar hemorrhage can cause occipital headaches, vomiting, and changes in level of consciousness.

239,Features of neurogenic shock are,"['↑Peripheral resistance ↓ cardiac output', '↑ Venous return ↑ cardiac output', '↓Peripheral resistence↓cardiac output', 'Venoconstriction ↓cardiac output']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the characteristics of neurogenic shock:

Neurogenic shock occurs when there is a sudden decrease in sympathetic nervous system activity, which typically results in vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) and a drop in blood pressure. This leads to a decrease in peripheral resistance and, as a consequence, a decrease in venous return and cardiac output.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. ↑Peripheral resistance ↓ cardiac output - This is not correct for neurogenic shock. Peripheral resistance decreases, not increases.

B. ↑ Venous return ↑ cardiac output - This is also incorrect. Neurogenic shock leads to a decrease in both venous return and cardiac output due to vasodilation and reduced sympathetic drive.

C. ↓Peripheral resistance↓cardiac output - This is correct. Neurogenic shock involves a decrease in peripheral resistance and a decrease in cardiac output due to the loss of sympathetic tone.

D. Venoconstriction ↓ cardiac output - This is incorrect because neurogenic shock involves vasodilation, not constriction of veins.

- **USG (Ultrasound)**: This is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and widely available method that can effectively visualize the carotid arteries and assess blood flow. It is particularly useful for detecting plaque and stenosis.
- **CT (Computed Tomography)**: While CT can provide detailed anatomical images, it is not as effective as ultrasound for visualizing blood flow and is generally more expensive and involves radiation exposure.
- **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: MRI can also provide high-quality anatomical images but is less commonly used for carotid artery stenosis screening due to its cost and the need for specialized equipment. It is more effective for assessing soft tissue but not as straightforward for blood flow visualization.
- **Doppler**: This is a type of ultrasound that specifically evaluates blood flow and is highly effective in detecting stenosis by assessing the velocity and direction of blood flow.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate and commonly used method for screening carotid artery stenosis invivo is Doppler ultrasound.

253,Inherited hyperammonemia is a result of deficiency of which enzyme of Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle?,"['Malate dehydrogenase', 'Isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'N-acetyl glutamate synthetase', 'Succinate dehydrogenase']","To determine the correct answer, let's first identify the key term in the question: inherited hyperammonemia is a condition where there is an excess of ammonia in the blood due to a genetic defect affecting the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a metabolic pathway that converts toxic ammonia into urea, which can then be excreted by the kidneys. This cycle is also known as the Krebs-Henseleit cycle.

Now, let's examine each of the options provided and see which enzyme, if deficient, would lead to inherited hyperammonemia:

A. Malate dehydrogenase - This enzyme is part of the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle), not the urea cycle. Its deficiency would not directly cause hyperammonemia.

B. Isocitrate dehydrogenase - This enzyme is also part of the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) and not the urea cycle. Its deficiency would not directly cause hyperammonemia.

C. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase - This enzyme is crucial for the synthesis of N-acetyl glutamate, a cofactor for the urea cycle enzyme arginase. Without sufficient N-acetyl glutamate, arginase cannot function properly, leading to a buildup of ammonia.

D. Succinate dehydrogenase - This enzyme is part of the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) and not the urea cycle. Its deficiency would not directly cause hyperammonemia.

Given this reasoning, the enzyme deficiency that leads to inherited hyperammonemia is N-acetyl glutamate synthetase.

261,"In which phase of cell cycle, proof reading occurs?","['G1', 'S', 'G2', 'M']","To determine in which phase of the cell cycle proofreading occurs, we need to understand the function of proofreading in DNA replication and the phases of the cell cycle.

Proofreading is a process that occurs during DNA replication, where the newly synthesized DNA is checked for errors. This process is primarily carried out by DNA polymerases, which can recognize and correct mismatches or errors that occur during replication.

The cell cycle is divided into the following phases:
- G1 (Gap 1): The cell grows and performs its normal functions. DNA is not replicated.
- S (Synthesis): DNA replication occurs.
- G2 (Gap 2): The cell continues to grow and prepare for mitosis. DNA is not replicated.
- M (Mitosis): The cell divides into two daughter cells.

Given this information, proofreading would occur during the S phase, when DNA replication is happening and any errors need to be corrected.

Diagnosis ?","['Pseudostrabismus', 'Accomodative squint', 'Exophoria', 'Esophoria']","Let's analyze the given information:

- The child has a mild squint.
- The intrauterine and birth history, as well as the developmental history till date, are all normal.
- The corneal reflex is normal.
- All other eye parameters are normal, except for an exaggerated epicanthal fold.

Given these details, the exaggerated epicanthal fold is a key point. An epicanthal fold is a fold of skin over the inner corner of the eye, common in some ethnic groups. An exaggerated epicanthal fold can sometimes mimic the appearance of a squint, but in the absence of true strabismus (misalignment of the eyes), this is known as pseudostrabismus.

It is particularly useful in evaluating the function of the bladder and the sphincter muscles. This test is indicated in cases where there is a need to assess bladder capacity, compliance, and the presence of bladder instability or neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. Neurogenic bladder - This condition involves a problem with the nerves that control the bladder, leading to issues like incontinence or difficulty in emptying the bladder. A cystometric study can help in diagnosing and assessing the severity of neurogenic bladder issues.

B. Stress incontinence - This condition involves the involuntary leakage of urine during physical activities that increase abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or laughing. While a urodynamic study (which can include cystometry) can provide detailed information, cystometry alone is not the primary tool for diagnosing stress incontinence.

C. Fistula - A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels. While diagnostic imaging and other tests might be used to identify a fistula, cystometry is not a primary diagnostic tool for this condition.

D. Urge incontinence - This condition involves a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. Cystometry can help in understanding bladder function and pressure, but other tests like urodynamic studies are more commonly used for diagnosing urge incontinence.

277,The number of ATPs generated in krebs cycleare ?,"['12', '24', '15', '30']","To determine the correct number of ATPs generated in the Krebs cycle, let's break down the process:

1. The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria.
2. During the cycle, several molecules are oxidized to produce NADH and FADH2, which are electron carriers.
3. These electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) then transfer electrons to the electron transport chain, where ATP is generated through oxidative phosphorylation.
4. The Krebs cycle itself does not directly produce ATP; instead, it generates NADH and FADH2, which are indirectly responsible for ATP production.
5. For each turn of the Krebs cycle, approximately 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 are produced.
6. Each NADH molecule produces approximately 2.5 ATPs and each FADH2 molecule produces approximately 1.5 ATPs.
7. Therefore, for each turn of the Krebs cycle, the number of ATPs produced is approximately (3 * 2.5) + (1 * 1.5) = 7.5 + 1.5 = 9 ATPs.

However, the options provided are not directly based on the ATPs produced in the Krebs cycle itself but rather the total ATPs generated from the cycle and other processes (glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation).

The correct answer is B, as the total ATPs generated from the Krebs cycle, including the indirect contribution from NADH and FADH2, is approximately 24 ATPs.

Among the options provided, the risk of torsades de pointes is specifically associated with terfenadine's effect on the QT interval.

Option A (Is coadministrator with azithromycin) and Option B (Is coadministrator with fluconazole) do not directly relate to the known effects of terfenadine on the QT interval. While there are drug interactions that can affect heart rhythm, these specific drugs are not primarily known to directly interact with terfenadine in a way that would cause torsades de pointes. 

Option C (Is given in higher doses) could potentially increase the risk of QT interval prolongation, but the specific mechanism and known interactions are not as well-documented as those with terfenadine and its effect on the QT interval.

Option D (Reduces QT interval) is incorrect because terfenadine actually prolongs the QT interval, not reduces it.

315,"In emergency, which aery can be safely ligated ?","['Internal iliac', 'Popliteal', 'Renal aeryInternal carotid', 'All']","To determine which artery can be safely ligated in an emergency, we need to consider the role each artery plays in the body.

- **A. Internal iliac artery**: Ligation of the internal iliac artery can be performed in cases of pelvic trauma or hemorrhage. It is a major artery supplying blood to the pelvic organs and lower limbs. While it is significant, in certain emergencies, it can be safely ligated without causing immediate life-threatening complications if the patient is not pregnant.

- **B. Popliteal artery**: This artery supplies blood to the knee and lower leg. Ligation of the popliteal artery could lead to severe tissue damage and necrosis, making it unsuitable for emergency ligation.

- **C. Renal artery**: The renal artery supplies blood to the kidneys. Ligation of the renal artery can lead to kidney damage and failure, making it unsuitable for emergency ligation.

- **D. All**: This option suggests that any of these arteries can be safely ligated in an emergency, which is not true as ligation of certain arteries (like the renal and popliteal) can lead to severe complications.

Given the considerations, the internal iliac artery is the most suitable for safe ligation in an emergency situation.

2. **Restriction of free water (Option B)**: This is a common and effective strategy for dilutional hyponatremia, especially in the absence of ADH (antidiuretic hormone) excess. It helps to concentrate the plasma and correct the sodium level over time.
3. **Plasma ultrafiltration (Option C)**: This is an invasive procedure and would be reserved for severe hyponatremia (typically <120 mEq/L) with symptoms or risk of central pontine myelinolysis.
4. **Hemodialysis (Option D)**: This is also an invasive and extreme measure typically used for severe and symptomatic hyponatremia, which is not the case here.

Given the patient's asymptomatic status and mild hyponatremia, the most appropriate management is to restrict free water to allow the body to naturally correct the sodium level.

378,The Triat in which the parents are clinically normal and only siblings are affected but males and females are affected in equal propoions is:,"['AD', 'AR', 'XLD', 'XLR']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option based on the information provided: parents are clinically normal, and only siblings are affected but males and females are affected in equal proportions.

- **AD ( Autosomal Dominant):** In AD, if one parent is affected, the offspring have a 50% chance of being affected. This pattern is inconsistent with the given scenario where only siblings are affected and parents are normal. Additionally, AD typically shows a higher chance of transmission from an affected parent to offspring.

- **AR ( Autosomal Recessive):** In AR, both parents must be carriers (heterozygous) for the affected gene, and there is a 25% chance of each child being affected. If siblings are affected and the parents are normal, this suggests that the condition is recessive and both parents must be carriers. This is consistent with the given information.

- **XLD ( X-linked Dominant):** In XLD, affected females will transmit the condition to all of their sons and none of their daughters. This would result in more females being affected, which is inconsistent with the scenario.

- **XLR ( X-linked Recessive):** In XLR, affected males pass the condition to all of their daughters but none of their sons. This would result in affected males and unaffected females, which is inconsistent with the scenario.

Given the scenario that only siblings are affected and both males and females are affected in equal proportions, the condition is best explained by **Autosomal Recessive (AR)** inheritance, where both parents are carriers.

383,Finger print bureau was first established in the following country:,"['India', 'England', 'USA', 'France']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the history of fingerprinting:

1. **India**: Fingerprinting was indeed used in India, but it wasn't the first country to establish a fingerprint bureau. The British colonial government in India adopted fingerprinting for record-keeping and identification purposes.

2. **England**: The United Kingdom, particularly England, is credited with the establishment of the first national fingerprint bureau. Sir William James Herschel, a British civil servant in India, first used fingerprints in 1858. However, the formal establishment of fingerprinting as an official identification system in England occurred later, in 1901, when Sir Edward Henry, a British police official, introduced the system and established the first fingerprint bureau.

3. **USA**: The United States did not establish a national fingerprint bureau as early as England. The U.S. began using fingerprints in the late 19th century but did not formalize a national system until much later.

4. **France**: France is known for its contributions to criminology and forensic science but did not establish a fingerprint bureau as early as England.

Considering the historical context, the first fingerprint bureau was established in England in 1901 by Sir Edward Henry.

386,Which of the following results in increase in secretion of ADH?,"['Hypervolemia', 'Hypeension', 'Hypovolemia', 'Decrease osmolarity']","Let's reason through the options:

A. Hypervolemia: This condition refers to excessive volume of blood in the circulatory system. Since the body already has an adequate or excess volume of fluid, it would not typically stimulate the secretion of ADH (antidiuretic hormone) to retain water.

B. Hypertension: This is a condition characterized by high blood pressure. High blood pressure does not directly influence the secretion of ADH. In fact, hypertension is often treated with diuretics that reduce fluid volume and can decrease ADH secretion by the pituitary gland.

C. Hypovolemia: This condition refers to a decrease in the volume of fluid in the circulatory system. When the body detects a decrease in fluid volume, it triggers the release of ADH to help conserve water and maintain blood volume.

D. Decrease osmolarity: Osmolarity refers to the concentration of solutes in the blood. A decrease in osmolarity would typically lead to a decrease in ADH secretion, as the body would not need to conserve water because the concentration of solutes is already low.

Given the above reasoning, the correct answer is C, as hypovolemia would stimulate ADH secretion to conserve water and maintain blood volume.

387,Urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is,"['<150 mmol/L', '<300 mmol/L', '<600 mmol/L', '<900 mmol/L']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what urine osmolality is and its significance in the context of Diabetes insipidus.

Urine osmolality is a measure of the concentration of solutes (electrolytes and waste) in the urine. In patients with Diabetes insipidus, the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively, leading to highly diluted urine. This means that the urine osmolality would be very low in patients with this condition.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. <150 mmol/L
B. <300 mmol/L
C. <600 mmol/L
D. <900 mmol/L

In Diabetes insipidus, the urine osmolality is typically very low, often less than 100 mmol/L, which is not directly listed in the options. However, we can infer that the lowest value provided that still indicates a low osmolality is 150 mmol/L. Therefore, the correct answer would be the option that indicates a very low osmolality.

388,"If hemoglobin status of a population with mean value is 10.3 gm % with SD 2 gm%, then 5% population will be below what value of Hb?","['6.67', '7.35', '9', '8.6']","To determine the Hb level below which 5% of the population falls, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution. In a normal distribution, approximately 5% of the data lies below approximately 1.645 standard deviations (SD) below the mean.

Given:
- Mean (μ) = 10.3 gm%
- Standard Deviation (σ) = 2 gm%

We need to find the Hb level that is 1.645 SDs below the mean:
\[ \text{Lower Bound} = \mu - 1.645 \times \sigma \]
\[ \text{Lower Bound} = 10.3 - 1.645 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Lower Bound} = 10.3 - 3.29 \]

389,1-a hydroxylation in Vitamin-D metabolism takes place in,"['Skin', 'Liver', 'Kidney', 'Blood']","To determine where the 1-hydroxylation in Vitamin-D metabolism takes place, we need to understand the pathway of Vitamin-D activation in the body. Vitamin-D is initially activated in the liver through a process called 25-hydroxylation, converting it to 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25(OH)D). This form is then transported to the kidneys where it undergoes a second hydroxylation, specifically at the 1-position, converting it to its most active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D (1,25(OH)2D).

Given the options provided:

A. Skin - While the skin is involved in the initial production of Vitamin-D through the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to Vitamin-D3 upon exposure to sunlight, it does not perform the 1-hydroxylation.
B. Liver - The liver is involved in the 25-hydroxylation, but not the 1-hydroxylation.
C. Kidney - This is the correct location for the 1-hydroxylation of Vitamin-D.
D. Blood - Blood does not perform any enzymatic reactions like hydroxylation.

390,"All of the following are required more during lactation as compared to pregnancy, except ?","['Iron', 'Vitamin A', 'Niacin', 'Energy']","Let's analyze each option in the context of lactation versus pregnancy:

A. Iron: During lactation, iron requirements increase due to the production of breast milk, which requires more iron. During pregnancy, iron requirements also increase to support fetal growth and placental development, but not as significantly as during lactation.

B. Vitamin A: Both during lactation and pregnancy, there is an increased need for vitamin A to support the immune system and other physiological functions. However, the increase during lactation is not as drastic as other nutrients.

C. Niacin: Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, requirements do increase during lactation to support milk production and other physiological functions. However, the increase is not as significant as the increase in iron or energy requirements during lactation.

D. Energy: Energy requirements increase significantly during lactation to support the production of breast milk, which can require up to 500 extra calories per day compared to non-pregnant or non-lactating states.

Considering the above points, vitamin A does not have a more significant increase during lactation compared to pregnancy.

392,"In sebaceous glands, accumulation of sebum leads to:","['Milia', 'Acne', 'Epidermoid cyst', 'Miliaria']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. Sebaceous glands are responsible for producing sebum, an oily substance that helps protect the skin and hair.

2. When sebum accumulates, it can lead to blockages in the hair follicles.

3. Milia are small, benign cysts that form when a dead skin cell gets trapped under the skin's surface and is surrounded by a protein called keratin. They are not directly related to sebum accumulation.

4. Acne occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, leading to inflammation and infection. This is the most common condition associated with sebum accumulation.

5. Epidermoid cysts are not directly related to sebum; they are formed when keratinized cells are trapped in the skin and form a cyst.

6. Miliaria (heat rash) occurs when sweat ducts become blocked, leading to the formation of small itchy red bumps, but it is not specifically related to sebum accumulation.

Given the options and the explanation, the condition most directly associated with the accumulation of sebum is acne.

395,Vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in,"['Duodenum', 'Ileum', 'Jejunum', 'Colon']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the process of vitamin B12 absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Vitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein produced by the parietal cells in the stomach. After vitamin B12 is released from food in the stomach, it must bind to intrinsic factor to facilitate its absorption. This complex then moves into the small intestine where most nutrients are absorbed.

The small intestine is divided into three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and is where most of the digestion occurs. The jejunum is the middle part and is where most of the absorption of nutrients from food takes place. The ileum is the last part of the small intestine and is where the remaining nutrients, including vitamin B12, are absorbed, especially with the help of intrinsic factor.

Given that intrinsic factor-bound vitamin B12 is specifically absorbed in the ileum, the correct answer is:

396,Zona Pellucida disappears by:-,"['Before ferilisation', 'During feilization', '5th day after feilization', '7th day after feilization']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein layer that surrounds the plasma membrane of the oocyte (egg). It plays a crucial role in fertilization.

2. During fertilization, several key events occur:
   - The sperm binds to the zona pellucida.
   - An acrosome reaction allows the sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida.
   - After penetration, the zona pellucida undergoes a change called the acrosome reaction block, making it impermeable to other sperm.

3. This change in the zona pellucida is a direct result of fertilization and serves to prevent polyspermy (fertilization by multiple sperm).

4. Therefore, the zona pellucida disappears or becomes impermeable as a consequence of fertilization, not before or after.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is B.

A. Antiviral cytotoxic T cell - These cells recognize viral peptides presented by MHC class I molecules on infected cells, which is an essential part of the adaptive immune response and is MHC-restricted.

B. Antibacterial helper T cell/cytotoxic cells - Helper T cells recognize bacterial peptides presented by MHC class II molecules, and cytotoxic T cells recognize these peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. Both types of T cells are MHC-restricted.

C. Allograft rejection - This process involves the immune response against donor cells (allografts) from another individual, which is also MHC-restricted because the recipient's immune system recognizes the donor cells as foreign due to differences in MHC molecules.

D. Autoimmune disorder - In autoimmune disorders, the immune system attacks the body's own cells and tissues. While the immune system does play a role in these conditions, MHC restriction is not a defining characteristic of autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders can occur regardless of MHC similarity between the self and the antigen-presenting cells.

1. **Insulin Deficiency**: Diabetes mellitus, particularly Type 1 diabetes, is characterized by a lack of insulin, which leads to increased levels of free fatty acids and ketone bodies as the body starts to break down fats for energy.

2. **Glucagon/Insulin Ratio**: In diabetes, the ratio of glucagon to insulin increases because insulin is low, and glucagon remains elevated. This leads to increased fatty acid mobilization and ketone body production.

3. **Blood Glucose and Free Fatty Acids**: In ketoacidosis, blood glucose levels are high due to insulin deficiency, and there is an increase in free fatty acids. However, these fatty acids do not directly equate to the blood glucose levels in terms of their role in the development of ketoacidosis.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A. **Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose**: The ratio of glucagon to insulin increases, and blood glucose is high, but CAMP (cyclic AMP) is not directly related to the development of ketoacidosis.

B. **Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose**: This statement is incorrect because free fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose.

C. **Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose**: This is accurate. Insulin is decreased, and free fatty acids are increased, but they are not equivalent to blood glucose.

D. **Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose**: This is incorrect because insulin is not elevated in diabetes mellitus, and free fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose.

The correct option is C.

426,Zero order kinetics is seen in all except,"['High dose salicylates', 'Phenytoin', 'Ethanol', 'Methotrexate']","To determine which option does not follow zero order kinetics, we need to understand the concept. Zero order kinetics occur when a drug is eliminated at a constant rate, independent of the drug concentration. This is typically observed at high doses or when the drug is eliminated via a fixed amount per unit time, such as through a saturable enzyme system or a fixed-capacity excretory mechanism.

- **High dose salicylates**: Salicylates follow zero order kinetics at high doses because the metabolism of salicylates through the liver is saturable.
- **Phenytoin**: Phenytoin follows zero order kinetics at high doses due to saturation of the hepatic microsomal enzyme system.
- **Ethanol**: Ethanol elimination follows zero order kinetics at high doses because the metabolism of ethanol is limited by the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase.
- **Methotrexate**: Methotrexate elimination follows first order kinetics, meaning it is not eliminated at a constant rate but rather proportional to the drug concentration.

Given this information, Methotrexate is the exception as it does not follow zero order kinetics.

438,Pain felt between great toe and 2nd toe is due to involvement of which nerve root -,"['L5', 'S2', 'S1', 'S3']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the nerve root distribution and the corresponding dermatomes and myotomes. The first toe (great toe) and the second toe are innervated by the S1 nerve root. The S1 nerve root is responsible for the skin on the lateral aspect of the foot and the muscles at the base of the toes.

- L5: Innervates the medial side of the foot and the big toe.
- S1: Innervates the lateral side of the foot and the second toe.
- S2: Innervates the lateral aspect of the leg and ankle.
- S3: Not typically associated with specific dermatomes in the foot but more with the perineal region.

Given that the pain is felt between the great toe and the second toe, it indicates involvement of the S1 nerve root.

439,"A 34-year-old female has a history of intermittent episodes of severe abdominal pain. She has had multiple abdominal surgeries and exploratory procedures with no abnormal findings. Her urine appears dark during an attack and gets even darker if exposed to sunlight. The attacks seem to peak after she takes erythromycin, because of her penicillin allergy. This patient most likely has difficulty in synthesizing which one of the following?","['Heme', 'Creatine phosphate', 'Cysteine', 'Thymine']","The patient's symptoms, including dark urine that gets even darker when exposed to sunlight, are indicative of a condition known as porphyria. Porphyria is a group of metabolic disorders resulting from the accumulation of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors in the body. The dark urine (also called ""melanoiduria"") and photosensitivity are characteristic features of acute interstitial porphyria, often caused by the overproduction of porphyrin precursors like porphobilinogen and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA).

Erythromycin is known to trigger symptoms in some patients with porphyria because it inhibits the enzyme ALA dehydratase, leading to a buildup of porphyrins and their precursors.

Heme is a component of hemoglobin and is synthesized through a pathway that is disrupted in porphyria. The dark color of the urine is due to the accumulation of porphyrins, which are heme precursors.

Therefore, the patient most likely has difficulty in synthesizing heme.

441,"All of the following can be involved in an injury to the head of the fibula, EXCEPT:","['Anterior tibial nerve', 'Common peroneal nerve', 'Superficial peroneal nerve', 'Tibial nerve']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. The head of the fibula is a prominence on the upper end of the fibula, which is the smaller of the two bones in the lower leg.

2. The nerves that can be injured in this area are those that run near the fibula. These include:
   - The common peroneal nerve, which branches into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves.
   - The anterior tibial nerve, which runs down the front of the leg to supply the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg and the dorsum of the foot.

3. The tibial nerve, on the other hand, runs down the back of the leg and is not in close proximity to the head of the fibula.

4. Therefore, the tibial nerve is the one that is least likely to be involved in an injury to the head of the fibula.

442,"In marasmus, which of the following is not seen?","['Edema', 'Voracious appetite', 'Hepatomegaly not seen', 'Child is active']","Let's analyze each option in the context of marasmus:

- **Option A (Edema):** Edema is a common sign of malnutrition but is more typically associated with kwashiorkor, not marasmus. Marasmus is characterized by severe weight loss and lack of fat and muscle mass, but not typically by fluid retention or edema.

- **Option B (Voracious appetite):** This is a characteristic of marasmus. Individuals with marasmus often have a voracious appetite due to the body's attempt to compensate for nutrient deficiencies.

- **Option C (Hepatomegaly not seen):** In marasmus, the liver is usually shrunken (microcytic), so hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) is not a feature. However, the statement ""Hepatomegaly not seen"" could be misleading because it might imply hepatomegaly is never seen in marasmus, which is incorrect. Hepatomegaly can occur but is not characteristic.

- **Option D (Child is active):** Children with marasmus are typically weak and lethargic due to severe malnutrition, so they are not active.

Given the analysis, the statement that is not accurate for marasmus is the one indicating the absence of hepatomegaly, as hepatomegaly can occur but is not characteristic. However, the question asks what is NOT seen, and the most direct and clear answer is the one related to the absence of a typical symptom in marasmus.

443,Which of the following is non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase?,"['L-Alanine', 'L-Tyrosine', 'L-Tryptophan', 'L-Phenylalanine']","To determine which of the given amino acids is a non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, we need to understand the nature of non-competitive inhibition. In non-competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds to a site other than the active site of the enzyme, thus altering the enzyme's conformation and reducing its catalytic efficiency. A common example of such an inhibitor among amino acids is L-Tryptophan.

L-Alanine, L-Tyrosine, and L-Phenylalanine are all structurally different from L-Tryptophan and do not typically act as non-competitive inhibitors of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. L-Tryptophan, however, has a large aromatic ring similar to that of the substrate and can bind to a site away from the active site, thus causing a conformational change that reduces enzyme activity without directly competing for the substrate-binding site.

1. **Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND)** - This is a standard surgical intervention for non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, especially when there is retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. Therefore, this is typically included in the treatment plan.

2. **Inguinal orchiectomy** - This is the initial surgical procedure to remove the affected testicle. It is a standard step in the treatment of testicular tumors.

3. **Chemotherapy** - Chemotherapy is often used in the treatment of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, especially when there is nodal involvement. Therefore, this is typically included in the treatment plan.

4. **Radiotherapy** - Radiotherapy is not typically the primary treatment for non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, especially when there is nodal involvement. It is generally reserved for specific circumstances, such as if the patient is not a candidate for surgery or chemotherapy, or for palliative purposes.

Given the options, the treatment that is **not** typically included in the standard management plan for a non-seminomatous testicular tumor with significant retroperitoneal lymph node involvement is radiotherapy.

- The **subscapular artery** arises from the axillary artery and supplies the upper back muscles, but not the upper limb.
- The **superior thoracic artery** arises from the subclavian artery and supplies the pectoralis major, intercostal, and diaphragm muscles.
- The **thyrocervical trunk** arises from the subclavian artery and divides into the inferior pharyngeal and transverse cervical arteries, not directly supplying the upper limb.
- The **suprascapular artery** arises from the thyrocervical trunk and supplies the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles of the shoulder, which are part of the upper limb.

Given the above, the subscapular artery and the thyrocervical trunk are not primarily responsible for supplying the upper limb. However, between the two, the subscapular artery is more directly associated with the back and not the upper limb, while the thyrocervical trunk can contribute to the circulation of the upper limb through its branches.

Tactile probing should not be used in this case because of all of the following EXCEPT?,"['Insertion  of  the  explorer  into  the  suspected lesion inevitably disrupts the surface layer covering very early lesions, thereby eliminating the possibility for remineralization of the decalcified area', 'Probing of lesions and suspected lesions results in the transport of  cariogenic  bacteria  from  one area  to another', 'Frank lesions requiring restoration are generally apparent visually  without  the  need  for  probing.', 'It may induce spontaneous bleeding']","Let's analyze each option in detail:

A. Insertion of the explorer into the suspected lesion inevitably disrupts the surface layer covering very early lesions, thereby eliminating the possibility for remineralization of the decalcified area. 
   - This is a valid reason to avoid probing, as it can disrupt early lesions and hinder remineralization.

B. Probing of lesions and suspected lesions results in the transport of cariogenic bacteria from one area to another.
   - This is also a valid reason to avoid probing, as it can spread bacteria and potentially worsen the condition.

C. Frank lesions requiring restoration are generally apparent visually without the need for probing.
   - This is a valid reason to avoid probing, as visually apparent lesions do not need additional probing to diagnose.

D. It may induce spontaneous bleeding.
   - This is not a valid reason to avoid probing in this context. While probing can sometimes cause minor bleeding, this is not a major concern in the context of diagnosing caries.

470,Most dangerous paicles causing pneumoconiosis are of size,"['A. 1-5 micron', 'B. <1 micron', 'C. 5-15 micron', 'D. 10-20 micron']","To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the size of particles that are most likely to cause pneumoconiosis. Pneumoconiosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling dust particles, particularly from coal, asbestos, and silica. The size of these particles significantly affects their ability to reach and lodge in the alveoli of the lungs.

1. **Particles larger than 15 microns** (Option D) are usually trapped in the upper airways and do not typically cause pneumoconiosis.

2. **Particles between 5-15 microns** (Option C) can reach the terminal bronchioles but are less likely to cause severe lung damage compared to smaller particles.

3. **Particles between 1-5 microns** (Option A) are more likely to reach the alveoli where they can cause inflammation and fibrosis, leading to pneumoconiosis.

4. **Particles smaller than 1 micron** (Option B) are often filtered by the nasal hairs and mucus in the respiratory tract and are less likely to cause pneumoconiosis.

Given these considerations, the most dangerous particles causing pneumoconiosis are those in the size range of 1-5 microns because they are more likely to reach and lodge in the alveoli, leading to lung damage.

473,Bidextrous grip is seen at what age?,"['4 months', '5 months', '6 months', '7 months']","To determine the correct age at which a bidextrous grip is typically seen, let's consider the developmental milestones for hand movements in infants.

A bidextrous grip, which involves the ability to grasp objects with both hands simultaneously and independently, is generally a more advanced motor skill that develops later in infancy. Earlier milestones include the raking grasp (using the thumb and fingers to bring objects towards the palm) around 4 months, and the pincer grasp (using the thumb and index finger) around 6 to 7 months.

Given these developmental milestones, the ability to perform a bidextrous grip is more likely to be observed around 7 months when the infant has developed sufficient motor control and coordination.

A. History: While a detailed history can provide clues, it is not definitive. Many patients with appendicitis may not present with classic symptoms, and the history can be non-specific.

B. Physical examination: This is often the first and most important step in diagnosing appendicitis. A physical exam, particularly in the right lower quadrant (Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, and obturator sign) can provide strong evidence for or against appendicitis. However, the physical examination alone is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis without further investigation.

C. X-ray abdomen: An abdominal X-ray is not a sensitive or specific test for appendicitis. It is more useful for ruling out other conditions, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

D. Ba meal: A barium enema (Ba meal) is used to visualize the intestines and is not typically used for diagnosing appendicitis. It is more relevant for conditions such as obstruction or malrotation.

Given these considerations, the most reliable initial step in diagnosing acute appendicitis is a thorough physical examination, which is often followed by further diagnostic tests such as a CT scan or ultrasound if the diagnosis is in doubt.

What is the appropriate diagnosis?","['Atrial septal defect', 'Coarctation of aoa, preductal', 'Patent ductus aeriosus', 'Truncus aeriosus']","To determine the correct diagnosis, let's analyze the clinical presentation and echocardiogram findings step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**:
   - The baby is 2 weeks old, irritable, and feeding poorly.
   - Physical examination reveals:
     - Irritability
     - Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
     - Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
     - Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
     - Circumoral cyanosis (bluish discoloration around the lips), which does not improve with nasal oxygen.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - Systolic thrill and holosystolic murmur along the left sternal border.
   - These findings suggest a significant left-to-right shunt, which is consistent with a condition that involves both the aorta and pulmonary artery.

3. **Echocardiogram Findings**:

A. Acute ureteral obstruction: This condition can cause a dense persistent nephrogram because the obstruction prevents contrast from flowing into the renal pelvis and ureters, leading to a dense image on imaging studies.

B. Systemic hypertension: While hypertension can affect kidney function and potentially lead to structural changes in the kidneys, it does not typically cause a dense persistent nephrogram. It may cause other renal changes but not this specific imaging finding.

C. Severe hydronephrosis: Severe blockage of urine flow can result in a dense persistent nephrogram as the affected kidney becomes enlarged and filled with urine, leading to a dense image on imaging.

D. Dehydration: Dehydration can lead to a dense persistent nephrogram because it reduces the amount of contrast available in the kidneys, resulting in a more concentrated image.

Given this reasoning, the condition that does not typically cause a dense persistent nephrogram is systemic hypertension.

526,Factor Xa is necessary for conversion of prothrombin to thrombin,"['Only in the extrinsic pathway', 'Only in the intrinsic pathway', 'As part of both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways', 'Only if the normal blood clotting cascade is inhibited']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand the role of Factor Xa in the blood clotting process. Factor Xa is a critical component of the coagulation cascade. It is involved in converting prothrombin to thrombin, which is a key step in the formation of a blood clot.

Factor Xa is generated in the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the coagulation cascade. In the intrinsic pathway, Factor Xa is activated by the contact system. In the extrinsic pathway, Factor Xa is generated through the action of tissue factor and factor VIIa. Both pathways converge at the activation of Factor X to Factor Xa, which then goes on to activate prothrombin to thrombin.

Given this information, Factor Xa is necessary for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin as part of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

528,A mutation that results in a value replacement for glutamic acid at position 6 of the B chain of hemoglobin 5 hinders normal hemoglobin function and results in sickle-cell anemia when the patient is homozygous for this mutation. This is an example of which of the following types of mutation?,"['Deletion', 'Frameshift', 'Inseion', 'Missense']","Let's analyze the given question step by step:

- The mutation described involves a single amino acid substitution in the hemoglobin molecule. Specifically, it changes glutamic acid at position 6 of the B chain.
- This type of mutation does not alter the reading frame of the genetic code, nor does it lead to a premature stop codon or an extension of the reading frame.
- The mutation simply replaces one amino acid with another, without changing the sequence of amino acids that follow.

Given these points, the type of mutation that fits this description is a missense mutation. Missense mutations are those in which a single nucleotide polymorphism leads to the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein sequence, but the reading frame remains intact.

565,Which of the following is NOT associated with elevation of prostatic specific antigen?,"['Acute prostatitis', 'BPH', 'Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm', 'Prostatic needle biopsy']","Let's analyze each option:

A. Acute prostatitis: This is an infection of the prostate gland, and it can lead to an elevated prostatic specific antigen (PSA) level.

B. BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia): This condition involves an enlarged prostate and can also cause a rise in PSA levels.

C. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm: This is a precancerous condition involving the prostate gland. Elevated PSA is commonly associated with this condition as well.

D. Prostatic needle biopsy: A prostatic needle biopsy is a procedure that involves taking tissue samples from the prostate. While this procedure can cause temporary elevation of PSA, it is not a condition itself. The elevation in PSA following the procedure is typically transient and not due to the condition itself but rather the procedure.

Given this analysis, the elevation of prostatic specific antigen is not directly associated with the procedure of a prostatic needle biopsy but rather with conditions such as prostatitis, BPH, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm.

A case-control study compares individuals with a disease (cases) to individuals without the disease (controls) to identify potential risk factors. The primary objective is to determine whether exposure to a particular factor (in this case, zarda pan) is more common in the case group (people with buccal carcinoma) than in the control group (people without buccal carcinoma).

Option A: ""CA is commoner in zarda pan users than non-users"" - This suggests a direct comparison in prevalence between users and non-users, which is not the primary goal of a case-control study. However, this could be a secondary finding.

Option B: ""Zarda pan is a cause of buccal CA"" - This implies a causal relationship, which a case-control study is not designed to definitively prove. It can suggest a relationship but cannot establish causation.

Option C: ""Zarda pan is associated with buccal CA"" - This is a more accurate statement for a case-control study. It suggests that there is a statistical relationship between the use of zarda pan and the occurrence of buccal carcinoma, which aligns with the primary goal of such a study.

Option D: ""If use of zarda pan is stopped, number of cases will reduce"" - This suggests a causal relationship and a future prediction, which goes beyond the scope of a case-control study. It assumes a direct causal link that the study may not definitively prove.

Given the options and the nature of a case-control study, the most accurate statement is that zarda pan is associated with buccal carcinoma.

576,The concetration of potassium in microgram in ORS is-,"['30 meq', '20 meq', '90 meq', '60 meq']","To determine the correct concentration of potassium in ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution), we need to understand the standard composition of ORS. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that ORS should contain 20 milliequivalents (meq) of potassium per liter of solution.

First, let's convert milliequivalents to micrograms. The typical molar mass of potassium (K) is approximately 39 g/mol. One meq of potassium is equivalent to 39 mg (since 1 meq = 1 mmol and 1 g/mol = 1000 mg/mol).

Given that ORS should have 20 meq/L of potassium, we can calculate the micrograms per liter as follows:
20 meq/L * 39 mg/meq = 780 mg/L

Since 1 mg = 1000 μg, we convert 780 mg to micrograms:
780 mg * 1000 μg/mg = 780,000 μg/L

However, the question asks for the concentration in micrograms, and the options provided are in meq. We need to match the provided options to the closest value.

- Option A: 30 meq

1. **Hepatosplenomegaly, fever, pallor, and generalized lymphadenopathy** are clinical findings that suggest a systemic illness, possibly an infectious or inflammatory condition.

2. **ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate)**: This is a non-specific test that can indicate inflammation or infection. It is useful in diagnosing conditions with these clinical features.

3. **Electrophoresis**: This technique is used to separate proteins based on their size and charge. It is not directly relevant to the clinical picture provided and is not typically used for diagnosing the conditions described.

4. **Parasite detection in aspirate**: This would be relevant if there was a suspicion of a parasitic infection, which is not indicated by the clinical findings. Given the systemic nature of the symptoms, this is less likely to be the primary test.

5. **ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)**: This test can be used to detect specific antibodies or antigens and is useful in diagnosing certain infectious diseases. It could be relevant if there is a suspicion of a specific infectious agent.

6. **Routine Hemogram**: This is a basic blood test that can provide information about the patient's blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help identify anemia (pallor), elevated white blood cells (suggesting infection or inflammation), and other abnormalities that might explain the symptoms.

Generally:

1. **Paranoid Schizophrenia** is considered to have a relatively better prognosis compared to other subtypes because patients often maintain their insight and cognitive function, and may have fewer social and occupational impairments.

2. **Catatonic Schizophrenia** tends to have a moderate prognosis. The symptoms can be severe and include catatonia, which can be challenging to manage, but with appropriate treatment, patients can improve.

3. **Simple Schizophrenia** is associated with a poorer prognosis compared to paranoid schizophrenia. It typically presents later in life, with a more insidious onset, and often includes negative symptoms and cognitive impairments.

4. **Disorganised Schizophrenia (Hebephrenic)** is considered to have the worst prognosis. Patients with this subtype often experience severe cognitive impairments, disorganized thinking, and flat or inappropriate affect, making it harder to respond to treatment.

Therefore, the order from the best prognosis to the worst prognosis is:

584,Pseudo pocket is seen in the,"['Base of the pocket lies on cementum', 'Gingivitis', 'Periodontitis', 'Base of the pocket and lies on alveolar bone']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what a ""pseudo pocket"" is. A pseudo pocket is a clinical finding where there is a periodontal pocket that appears to be deeper than it actually is, usually due to inflammation of the gingiva. This means that the pocket does not extend below the level of the alveolar bone, but rather the base of the pocket lies on the gingival tissue rather than the alveolar bone.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A. Base of the pocket lies on cementum - This would describe a true periodontal pocket, not a pseudo pocket.
B. Gingivitis - While gingivitis can cause inflammation, it does not specifically describe the location of the base of a pocket.
C. Periodontitis - Similar to option B, this describes an inflammatory condition but does not specify the location of the pocket base.
D. Base of the pocket and lies on alveolar bone - This describes a true pocket, not a pseudo pocket.

Sarcomeres are the segments of the muscle fiber that contain thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments, and they are the smallest portion of muscle fiber that can produce force independently.

- Actin and myosin are proteins that form the filaments within the sarcomere and are crucial for muscle contraction.
- Troponin is a regulatory protein that works with tropomyosin to control the interaction between actin and myosin.

Therefore, the sarcomere is the functional unit that performs the contraction of muscle fibers.

594,Bilateral destruction of auditory cortex in man causes,"['Almost total deafness', 'Hearing defect for higher frequency sounds', 'Deficiency in interpretation of sounds', 'Inability for the orientation of sounds']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. The auditory cortex is crucial for processing auditory information.
2. Bilateral destruction means both sides of the cortex are affected.
3. Auditory cortex processes are necessary for interpreting sounds and understanding their meaning.
4. If both auditory cortices are destroyed, the brain would lose its ability to interpret sounds.
5. The other options describe more specific or partial impairments:
   - Option A (almost total deafness) implies a loss of hearing ability, not just an issue with interpretation.
   - Option B (hearing defect for higher frequency sounds) is too specific and doesn't encompass bilateral destruction.
   - Option D (inability for the orientation of sounds) refers to spatial awareness of sound sources, which would be affected if the interpretation is gone but is not the primary function of the auditory cortex.

The correct answer is the one that best describes the loss of the ability to interpret sounds, which is the primary function of the auditory cortex when it is damaged.

Amyloidosis is a condition where an abnormal protein, amyloid, builds up in the body's tissues and organs. In the context of the tongue, amyloidosis can affect various structures within the tongue.

- **Option A: Stromal connective tissue** - Amyloidosis often involves the deposition of amyloid in the connective tissues of various organs. This is a plausible location for amyloid deposition in the tongue as well.
- **Option B: Cells of the surface epithelium** - Amyloid deposition in the surface epithelium is less common compared to the stromal connective tissue. Typically, the underlying connective tissue is more affected.
- **Option C: Nuclei of the striated muscle cells** - The nuclei of muscle cells are generally not the primary site for amyloid deposition. Amyloid tends to affect extracellular spaces rather than cell nuclei.
- **Option D: Cytoplasm of the striated muscle cells** - Similar to option C, the cytoplasm of muscle cells is not a common site for amyloid deposition.

Given these points, the most accurate site for amyloid deposition in the tongue, based on the typical patterns of amyloidosis, is the stromal connective tissue.

602,The following infection resembles malignancy -,"['Echinococcus granulosus', 'E. multilocularis', 'E.vogeli', 'E. oligarthus']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the characteristics of each option in relation to their clinical presentations. Echinococcus granulosus, E. multilocularis, E. vogeli, and E. oligarthus are all species of the genus Echinococcus, which can cause echinococcosis, a parasitic infection.

- Echinococcus granulosus is the most common species and causes hydatid cyst disease. The clinical presentation is typically benign, with the cysts causing symptoms similar to a benign tumor, but they do not resemble malignancy.

- E. multilocularis is less common and causes alveolar echinococcosis, which is a more aggressive form of echinococcosis that can metastasize and resemble malignancy. The lesion can grow and infiltrate surrounding tissues, leading to symptoms similar to those of cancer.

- E. vogeli and E. oligarthus are less significant in human disease compared to the other species and are not as likely to cause a presentation that resembles malignancy.

Given the information, E. multilocularis is the species that most closely resembles malignancy due to its aggressive behavior and potential to metastasize.

603,Persistent vomiting in G.O.O. causes -a) Hyponatremic hyperchloremia occurb) Hypernatremia without ↓ed Cl- alkalosisc) Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosisd) Paradoxical aciduria,"['cd', 'bc', 'bd', 'ac']","Let's reason through each option step-by-step:

1. **Understanding Persistent Vomiting in Gastroenteritis (G.O.O.):**
   - Gastroenteritis often leads to persistent vomiting, which can result in significant fluid and electrolyte losses.

2. **Effect of Persistent Vomiting on Electrolytes and Fluids:**
   - Vomiting results in the loss of gastric contents, which contain electrolytes like sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. This leads to a net loss of these electrolytes, particularly sodium and chloride.
   - Since bicarbonate is a component of the gastric contents, its loss can also contribute to metabolic alkalosis, which is a condition where the blood becomes more alkaline (higher pH).

3. **Analyzing Each Option:**
   - **a) Hyponatremic hyperchloremia occurs:**
     - This is incorrect because persistent vomiting leads to hypochloremia (low chloride levels) due to the loss of chloride-rich gastric contents.
   - **b) Hypernatremia without ↓ed Cl- alkalosis:**
     - This is incorrect because persistent vomiting typically leads to hypovolemia, which can result in hyponatremia, not hypernatremia.
   - **c) Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis:**
     - This is correct. Persistent vomiting can lead to loss of potassium (hypokalemia) and bicarbonate (leading to metabolic alkalosis).
   - **d) Paradoxical aciduria:**
     - This is incorrect because metabolic alkalosis (as a result of vomiting) would generally not cause paradoxical aciduria. Paradoxical aciduria is more commonly seen in certain specific conditions like Bartter syndrome or Liddle syndrome.

4. **Combining the Correct Options:**
   - The correct combination is **c) Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis**.

612,If a drug is active against the pre-erythrocytic stage of the malarial parasite it will be useful as a:,"['Suppressive prophylactic', 'Causal prophylactic', 'Clinical curative', 'Radical curative']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand the different types of treatments for malaria:

- **Suppressive prophylactic**: This type of prophylaxis aims to prevent the parasite from becoming established in the liver (pre-erythrocytic stage) before it can enter the bloodstream and cause symptoms.
- **Causal prophylactic**: This is similar to suppressive prophylaxis but focuses on preventing the development of the parasite in the liver after a mosquito bite, but it is less effective than suppressive prophylaxis.
- **Clinical curative**: This treatment is aimed at curing an active infection once symptoms have appeared.
- **Radical curative**: This treatment aims to eliminate the parasite from the body, including any dormant forms in the liver, to prevent relapse.

Given that the drug is active against the pre-erythrocytic stage of the malarial parasite, it would be most effective in preventing the parasite from entering the bloodstream and causing symptoms. Therefore, it would be most useful as a prophylactic measure, specifically a suppressive prophylactic, which prevents the parasite from establishing in the liver.

619,"In a family, the father has widely spaced eyes, increased facial hair and deafness. One of the three children has deafness with similar facial features. The mother is normal. Which one of the following is most likely pattern of inheritance in this case?","['Autosomal dominant', 'Autosomal recessive', 'X-linked dominant', 'X-linked recessive']","Let's analyze the given information:

1. The father has widely spaced eyes, increased facial hair, and deafness. One of the three children also has deafness with similar facial features, and the mother is normal.

2. Autosomal dominant inheritance: If a condition is autosomal dominant, only one copy of the gene from either parent is needed to pass the condition to the child. If the mother were affected, both parents would likely show symptoms, which is not the case here. Additionally, the mother being normal but having an affected child suggests that the father carries the dominant allele.

3. Autosomal recessive inheritance: For an autosomal recessive condition, both parents must be carriers to have an affected child. However, the mother being normal and the father showing symptoms is less likely to follow an autosomal recessive pattern.

4. X-linked dominant inheritance: This would typically manifest in males as they only have one X chromosome, which they inherit from their mother. If the mother is affected, all her sons would be affected and all her daughters would be carriers. However, the mother is normal, so this is unlikely.

5. X-linked recessive inheritance: This would typically only manifest in males if they inherit the recessive allele from their mother. Since the mother is normal, this is also unlikely.

Given that the father shows symptoms and one of the children does as well, and considering the mother is normal, the most likely pattern of inheritance is that the father is a carrier of a dominant allele on an autosomal chromosome.

621,The most impoant prognostic factor of Wilms tumor-,"['Histopathology', 'Ploidy of cells', 'Age < 1 y', 'Mutation of c 1p gene']","To determine the most important prognostic factor of Wilms tumor, let's evaluate each option:

A. Histopathology: The appearance of the tumor under a microscope can provide critical information about the tumor's aggressiveness and type, which is highly relevant to prognosis.

B. Ploidy of cells: The number of chromosomes in a cell can indicate the aggressiveness of the tumor, but it is not as commonly used as other factors in the clinical setting.

C. Age < 1 y: Young age at diagnosis is generally a favorable prognostic factor in Wilms tumor because it is often associated with a better response to treatment and a higher rate of cure.

D. Mutation of c 1p gene: While genetic mutations can be important, the specific mutation of c 1p gene is not as uniformly recognized or widely used as a prognostic factor compared to other factors listed.

Considering these points, the most important and commonly used prognostic factor in Wilms tumor is the age of the patient, specifically whether the patient is less than 1 year old.

Mostlikely cause is:,"['Trauma', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Syphilis', 'Congenital']","To determine the most likely cause of an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta (AoA) in a 70-year-old man with abdominal pain and a mass, let's consider each option:

A. Trauma: While trauma can cause an aneurysm, it is less common in a 70-year-old man without a history of significant injury.

B. Atherosclerosis: Atherosclerosis is a common condition in older adults, where fatty deposits build up in the arteries, leading to thickening and hardening of the arterial walls. This condition is a significant risk factor for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

C. Syphilis: While syphilis can cause aneurysms, it is not a common cause in the absence of other syphilis-related complications and is less likely to be the primary cause in an otherwise healthy 70-year-old man.

D. Congenital: While congenital conditions can lead to aneurysms, they are rare and usually present from birth or during childhood. In a 70-year-old man, this is less likely.

a) Non-invasive: This is not accurate as brachytherapy typically involves the placement of radioactive sources inside or near the tumor, which is an invasive procedure.

b) Less radiation hazard to normal tissue: This is a true advantage of brachytherapy. Since the radiation is delivered internally and can be precisely targeted, the exposure to normal tissues outside the treatment area is significantly reduced.

c) Max.radiation to diseased tissue: This is accurate. Brachytherapy allows for a high dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues.

d) Can be given in all malignancies: This is not correct. Brachytherapy is more commonly used for certain types of cancers, such as cervical, prostate, and breast cancers, but not all malignancies.

e) Doesn't require trained personnel: This is incorrect. Brachytherapy requires specialized equipment and trained personnel to safely and effectively deliver the treatment.

We are dealing with comparing means from two independent groups, which suggests we should use a statistical test that can compare the means of two groups.

- **Student's t-test (Option A)** is used to compare the means of two groups. It can be either a paired t-test for dependent samples or an independent samples t-test for independent samples. Since the question mentions two groups of children, an independent samples t-test (Student's t-test) would be appropriate.
  
- **Linear regression (Option B)** is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. While it can be used to study relationships, it is not the most straightforward choice for comparing means of two groups.
  
- **Chi-square test (Option C)** is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories. It is not suitable for comparing means.
  
- **Test of proportions (Option D)** is used to compare the proportions of a characteristic between two groups. It is not appropriate for comparing means.

- **Can-opener capsulotomy (A)**: This is a technique where a circular incision is made in the anterior capsule using a specialized instrument that resembles a can opener. While it was historically used, it has largely been replaced by other techniques due to potential complications.

- **Intercapsular capsulotomy (B)**: This term is less commonly used in the context of phacoemulsification. Typically, when discussing capsulotomy, it refers to a circular opening rather than a technique involving the intercapsular space.

- **Capsulorhexis (C)**: This is a newer and more precise technique where a circular opening is created in the anterior capsule using a capsulorhexis forceps or a similar instrument. It is the most common method used in modern phacoemulsification due to its precision and lower complication rates.

- **Envelop capsulotomy (D)**: This term is not standard in ophthalmic surgery and does not refer to any specific technique.

Given these points, the most common method of anterior capsulotomy in phacoemulsification is Capsulorhexis.

Which is the test to monitor response to treatment?","['VDRL', 'FTA ABS', 'TPI', 'RPR']","To determine the correct test to monitor the response to treatment, we need to consider the medical history and the symptoms described. The patient presented with a penile ulcer three years back, which suggests a possible infection like syphilis, as ulcers can be a symptom of primary syphilis. Later, he developed neurological symptoms, which can be a sign of neurosyphilis, indicating that the infection may have progressed to a later stage.

The tests listed are all used to diagnose syphilis, but they are used in different stages of the disease:

- VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) are nonspecific serological tests that detect antibodies to heart lipoproteins. They are used to screen for syphilis but can give false positives and are not as specific as TPI (Treponema pallidum particle agglutination) or FTA ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption).

- TPI (Treponema pallidum particle agglutination) is a more specific test for syphilis and is used in confirmatory testing.

- FTA ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) is a confirmatory test for syphilis that detects specific antibodies against Treponema pallidum.

For monitoring the response to treatment, a more specific test like FTA ABS is preferred because it is less likely to show false positive results and can provide a more accurate assessment of the treatment response.

Therefore, the test to monitor the response to treatment in this case would be FTA ABS.

A. Greater potential to block a resting nerve as compared to a stimulated nerve - Local anesthetics typically block the nerve more effectively when the nerve is at rest because during the resting state, the sodium channels are closed, making it easier to block the conduction. When the nerve is stimulated, sodium channels are open, making it harder to block the conduction.

B. Need to cross the cell membrane to produce the block - Local anesthetics do not need to cross the cell membrane to produce a block. Instead, they bind to the sodium channels on the outside of the membrane.

C. Large myelinated fibers are blocked before small myelinated fibers - This is not typically the case. Local anesthetics usually block small unmyelinated fibers first because they have a smaller diameter and thinner myelin sheath, making them more susceptible to blockage.

D. Cause consistent change of resting membrane potential - Local anesthetics do not cause a consistent change in the resting membrane potential. They block the sodium channels, preventing sodium ions from entering the cell, which can lead to a reduced action potential, but this is not a change in the resting potential itself.

Considering the above points, the correct option is A.

643,Most useful for sex determination is: Kerala 08,"['Skull', 'Femur', 'Pelvis', 'Tibia']","To determine the correct answer, we need to consider which bone is most useful for sex determination. The pelvis is a critical bone for sex determination because it shows significant differences between males and females, particularly in the shape and size of the pelvic inlet and the pubic arch angle.

- The skull can show some differences, but they are less reliable than those found in the pelvis.
- The femur and tibia do not show as distinct sexual dimorphism as the pelvis does.

Therefore, the most useful bone for sex determination is the pelvis.

644,Post coital test showing non motile sperms in the cervical smear and Motile sperms from the posterior fornix suggests :,"['Faulty coital practice', 'Immunological defect', 'Hypospadias', 'Azoospermia']","Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. **Post Coital Test (PCT) showing non-motile sperms in the cervical smear:**
   - This suggests that the sperm that were present in the cervix immediately after intercourse were not motile (not moving or moving poorly).

2. **Motile sperms from the posterior fornix:**
   - The posterior fornix is a part of the female reproductive tract, located deeper within the vagina. The presence of motile sperms here indicates that some sperm managed to move through the cervix and into the uterine cavity or further.

Given these observations, the most plausible explanation is that there is a defect in the cervical mucus, which is preventing the sperm from moving properly. This can be due to various factors such as cervical conditions or immunological factors affecting the cervical mucus. 

- **Option A (Faulty coital practice):** This is unlikely because the test shows that some sperm were present in the posterior fornix, indicating that intercourse was likely performed correctly.
- **Option B (Immunological defect):** This is a plausible explanation as immunological factors can affect the cervical mucus, leading to non-motile sperms.
- **Option C (Hypospadias):** This is a congenital condition affecting the penis and is not directly related to the cervical mucus or the post-coital test results.
- **Option D (Azoospermia):** This condition is characterized by the complete absence of sperm in the ejaculate, which is not the case here as motile sperms are found in the posterior fornix.

Considering the context and the observations, the most appropriate answer is:

The final answer is B.",B,0.9981684630287904,A,False
645,The number of line angles in a permanent maxillary central incisor is,"['Two', 'Four', 'Six', 'Eight']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the components of a maxillary central incisor:

1. A maxillary central incisor has two clinical crowns: one on the labial (lip) side and one on the lingual (tongue) side.
2. Each crown has two surfaces: the labial and the lingual.
3. Each surface has two line angles where the surfaces meet: the incisal angle and the mesial angle on the labial side, and the incisal angle and the distal angle on the lingual side.

Counting the line angles:
- Labial surface: incisal and mesial angles (2 angles)
- Lingual surface: incisal and distal angles (2 angles)

Adding these together, we get a total of 4 line angles.

647,Features of alcohol withdrawl are all EXCEPT: March 2013,"['Epileptic seizure', 'Restlessness', 'Hallucination', 'Hypersomnolence']","To determine the correct answer, let's review the common symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol withdrawal can present with a variety of signs and symptoms, including seizures, anxiety and restlessness, hallucinations, and insomnia or hypersomnolence (sleep disturbances).

- **Epileptic seizure**: This is a known symptom of severe alcohol withdrawal, especially in individuals with a history of seizures.
- **Restlessness**: This is also a common symptom of alcohol withdrawal.
- **Hallucination**: Hallucinations can occur during severe alcohol withdrawal, particularly delirium tremens.
- **Hypersomnolence**: This term refers to excessive sleepiness or an increased need for sleep. While alcohol withdrawal can lead to disturbances in sleep patterns, hypersomnolence is not typically a primary symptom; rather, it is often the opposite—insomnia or disrupted sleep patterns.

Given the above, hypersomnolence is not a typical primary symptom of alcohol withdrawal.

648,DOC for listeria meningitis:,"['Ampicillin', 'Cefotaxime', 'Cefotriaxone', 'Ciprofloxacin']","To determine the appropriate antibiotic for listeria meningitis, we need to consider the antimicrobial susceptibility of Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is generally susceptible to ampicillin and other penicillins. Cefotaxime and cefotrioxone are third-generation cephalosporins, which are broad-spectrum antibiotics but not typically the first choice for listeria infections. Ciprofloxacin is an fluoroquinolone, which is effective against many gram-negative bacteria but not the primary choice for Listeria infections.

Given these points, the most appropriate antibiotic for treating listeria meningitis is ampicillin.

A. ""Occurs in premature infants due to late crying"" - This statement is incorrect. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is not caused by late crying. It is a disease of the retinal vasculature that occurs in premature infants due to abnormal blood vessel growth, often related to prematurity and hypoxia.

B. ""Due to hypoxia there occurs neovascularization followed by fibroproliferation"" - This statement is correct. ROP is indeed caused by hypoxia or ischemia, which leads to the growth of abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization), and this can progress to fibrous tissue proliferation.

C. ""End result is bilateral blindness"" - While severe cases of ROP can lead to blindness, this is not always the case. Many infants with ROP do not progress to the most severe stages, and treatment can prevent blindness. Therefore, this statement is too absolute.

D. ""Blindness can be prevented by early diagnosis and ablation of vascular premature retina with cryotherapy or photocoagulation"" - This statement is correct. Early detection and timely intervention with treatments like cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation can prevent severe complications, including blindness.

Considering these points, the statement that is not entirely true is A, as ROP is not caused by late crying.

656,Patient on treatment on carbidopa + levodopa for 10 yrs now has weaning off effect. What should be added to restore action -,"['Tolcapone', 'Amantadine', 'Rasagiline', 'Benzhexol']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of treating Parkinson's disease (PD) and managing levodopa-related issues such as wearing-off effects.

1. **Tolcapone (A)**: This is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that can prolong the effects of levodopa. It is used to manage ""wearing-off"" and ""on-off"" fluctuations in PD. However, it is not typically the first choice for managing levodopa-induced wearing-off effects.

2. **Amantadine (B)**: Amantadine is an antiviral medication that also has dopaminergic effects and can help manage motor fluctuations and dyskinesias associated with long-term levodopa use. It is often used as an add-on therapy to levodopa to manage wearing-off effects, especially in early PD.

3. **Rasagiline (C)**: This is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that can be used as an add-on therapy to levodopa. It helps to delay the wearing-off effects and can be beneficial in managing PD symptoms, but it is not typically the first choice for immediate management of wearing-off effects.

4. **Benzhexol (D)**: This is a butyrophenone that acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist. It is used to control dyskinesias in PD but does not help in managing wearing-off effects.

Given the options, Amantadine (B) is commonly used as an add-on therapy to manage wearing-off effects in PD patients on long-term levodopa treatment.

657,Diagnosis of carcinoid tumors is done by:,"['5HIAA', 'DHEA', 'DHEA', 'Metanephrines']","To determine the correct answer, let's review the diagnostic markers for carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors can secrete various hormones and vasoactive substances, and their diagnosis often involves identifying these substances in the blood or urine. 

- **5-HIAA (5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid)**: This is a metabolite of serotonin and is commonly used to diagnose and monitor carcinoid syndrome, a condition associated with carcinoid tumors.
- **DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone)**: This is a steroid hormone and is not specific to carcinoid tumors.
- **Metanephrines**: These are metabolites of catecholamines (like epinephrine and norepinephrine) and are used to diagnose pheochromocytomas, not carcinoid tumors.

Given the above information, the correct diagnostic marker for carcinoid tumors is 5-HIAA.

658,Features of shock,"['Decreased GFR', 'Increased renin', 'Decreased rennin', 'Decreased Coisol']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of shock:

A. Decreased GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate): In shock, there is reduced blood flow to the kidneys, leading to decreased GFR as a compensatory mechanism to conserve blood volume. This is a common feature in shock states.

B. Increased renin: Renin release is a part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is activated during shock to try to increase blood pressure by constricting blood vessels and increasing water and sodium retention. Therefore, increased renin is a common feature in shock.

C. Decreased rennin: This is incorrect because rennin is actually renin, and in shock, renin levels are typically increased, not decreased.

D. Decreased cortisol: Cortisol levels can be decreased in severe shock states, particularly septic shock, as a result of the body's response to stress. However, this is not as universally present as the other options, and it's not the primary feature of shock.

Given the context of the question, the most commonly recognized features of shock among the options provided are increased renin. The final answer is B.",B,0.7564287384988857,A,False

660,Which of  the following has strongest association with osteosarcoma?,"['Wilms tumor', 'Retinoblastoma', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Ewings tumor']","To determine which condition has the strongest association with osteosarcoma, let's consider the known associations in pediatric and adolescent cancers.

- **Wilms tumor** is a renal (kidney) tumor and is associated with conditions like WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and Intellectual disability) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, but not specifically with osteosarcoma.
- **Retinoblastoma** is an eye cancer, and while it has a strong association with hereditary cancer syndromes (such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome which also increases the risk of osteosarcoma), the primary association is with eye tumors.
- **Rhabdomyosarcoma** is a soft tissue sarcoma that arises from primitive mesenchymal cells and is more commonly associated with conditions like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or WAGR syndrome, but it is not specifically linked to osteosarcoma.
- **Ewing tumor (Ewing sarcoma)** is another type of bone tumor that can occur in children and adolescents, and it has been noted to have a stronger association with osteosarcoma compared to the other conditions listed. Both are more common in younger individuals and can occur in similar bones.

Given this reasoning, the correct answer is that Ewing tumor has a stronger association with osteosarcoma.

661,The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is ceain in which of the following situations?,"['Abnormal oral glucose tolerance in a 24-yrs-old woman who has been dieting', 'Successive fasting plasma glucose concentrations of 8, 9, and 8.5 mmol/L in an asymptomatic, otherwise healthy businesswoman', 'A serum glucose level >7.8 mmol/L in a woman in her twenty-fifth week of gestation after a 50-g oral glucose load', 'Persistent asymptomatic glycosuria in a 30-yrs-old woman']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option based on the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus.

A. Abnormal oral glucose tolerance in a 24-yrs-old woman who has been dieting: An abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) might suggest prediabetes or early signs of diabetes, but it is not definitive for a diagnosis of diabetes. Dieting can affect glucose levels, making this option less reliable.

B. Successive fasting plasma glucose concentrations of 8, 9, and 8.5 mmol/L in an asymptomatic, otherwise healthy businesswoman: While these levels are above the normal fasting glucose range (3.9-6.1 mmol/L), they are not consistently high enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes (fasting plasma glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or higher). Therefore, this does not confirm diabetes.

C. A serum glucose level >7.8 mmol/L in a woman in her twenty-fifth week of gestation after a 50-g oral glucose load: This level is within the normal range for gestational diabetes, which typically requires higher glucose levels (≥7.8 mmol/L at 2 hours) to be diagnosed. This is not definitive for diabetes mellitus.

D. Persistent asymptomatic glycosuria in a 30-yrs-old woman: Glycosuria (the presence of glucose in the urine) can indicate uncontrolled diabetes, especially when persistent and asymptomatic. This is a strong indicator and often seen in individuals with diabetes.

Given the criteria for diagnosing diabetes, the most definitive option is D, as persistent glycosuria in the absence of other symptoms strongly suggests uncontrolled diabetes.

662,A 6 years child has foreign body in trachea .Best initial management is,"[""Heimlich's maneuver"", 'Cardiac massage', 'Intubation', 'Oxygen mask with IPPV']","For a 6-year-old child with a foreign body in the trachea, the immediate concern is to ensure the airway is not obstructed. The Heimlich maneuver is specifically designed to dislodge foreign objects from the airway, making it the most appropriate initial management.

The steps of the Heimlich maneuver involve standing behind the child, wrapping your arms around their waist, making a fist with one hand and placing it slightly above the navel, and then pulling inward and upward to create an upward and inward pressure to dislodge the object.

Cardiac massage would be appropriate if the child has no pulse, which is not the case here. Intubation and IPPV (Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation) are interventions that would be used if the child is not breathing and the airway cannot be cleared by other means, which is not the best initial step in this scenario.

663,A six year old male baby presents to a hospital with recurrent gross hematuria for 2 years. There is no h/o burning micturition or pyuria. Urine routine examination demonstrated no pus cells and urine culture was sterile. Serum C3 levels were normal. What is the most probable diagnosis-,"[""Wilm's tumour"", 'IgA nephropathy', 'Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis', 'Urinaiy tract infection']","Let's analyze the given information:

- The patient is a 6-year-old male with recurrent gross hematuria for 2 years.
- There is no history of burning micturition or pyuria.
- Urine routine examination did not show pus cells, and urine culture was sterile.
- Serum C3 levels were normal.

Given these details, we can rule out some options:

- Option A (Wilm's tumour) is less likely because it is usually associated with other symptoms such as a palpable abdominal mass, hypertension, and anemia. Hematuria alone is not a definitive sign of Wilm's tumour.
- Option C (Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) is unlikely because it typically follows an upper respiratory or skin infection and presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and edema, often associated with a preceding streptococcal infection, which is not mentioned here.
- Option D (Urinaiy tract infection) is not likely because the urine culture was sterile and there is no history of symptoms suggesting a UTI.

IgA nephropathy is a condition that can present with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria, often without other symptoms like pain or infection. The absence of pyuria, normal serum C3 levels, and sterile culture support this diagnosis.

664,"All of the following statements about neuromuscular blockage produced by succinylcholine are true, except:","['No fade on Train of four stimulation', 'Fade on tetanic stimulation', 'No post tetanic facilitation', 'Train of four ratio > 0.4']","To determine which statement is not true about neuromuscular blockage produced by succinylcholine, let's analyze each option:

A. No fade on Train of four stimulation: Succinylcholine causes a non-depolarizing block, meaning that repeated stimulation (like the train of four) does not show a fade in response. This is a characteristic of succinylcholine.

B. Fade on tetanic stimulation: Tetanic stimulation usually causes a fade in responses for non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, but succinylcholine does not produce a fade on tetanic stimulation. This is because succinylcholine acts as a depolarizing muscle relaxant.

C. No post tetanic facilitation: Post-tetanic facilitation is a characteristic of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, where a tetanic stimulus before a train of twos or four can enhance the response. Since succinylcholine does not produce a fade on tetanic stimulation, it also does not show post-tetanic facilitation.

D. Train of four ratio > 0.4: This is a characteristic of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, where the train of four ratio (the ratio of the second twitch to the first twitch) decreases over time. However, succinylcholine causes a depolarizing block, which does not follow the same pattern as non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.

The statement that does not apply to succinylcholine is B, as tetanic stimulation does not cause a fade but rather maintains a stable effect.

A. OCPs (Oral Contraceptive Pills) - These do not directly cause actinomycosis but can alter the vaginal flora, which might indirectly influence the risk of infections. However, the primary risk associated with OCPs is more related to thromboembolic events and not specifically actinomycosis.

B. Condom - Condoms do not increase the risk of actinomycosis. They are used to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and do not have a direct impact on the risk of actinomycosis.

C. IUCD (Intrauterine Contraceptive Device) - Some studies suggest that IUCDs can slightly increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infections in the reproductive tract, potentially increasing the risk of actinomycosis if the bacteria enter the cervix. However, the primary risk is more related to PID rather than actinomycosis itself.

D. Vaginal - This option is not clear as it could refer to vaginal douches, creams, or other products. If we consider it in the context of products, they are generally not associated with an increased risk of actinomycosis.

Given the analysis, the IUCD (option C) is the most closely associated with an increased risk of infections that could potentially lead to actinomycosis due to its influence on the reproductive tract.

666,True about gastric acid secretion:,"['Secretion ,l,ses with secretin', 'H2 blockers prevent release', 'Total acid output indicates parietal cell mass activity', 'All']","Let's analyze each option:

A. Secretion, l,ses with secretin - This statement is incorrect. Gastric acid secretion is stimulated by secretin, not inhibited. Secretin actually decreases gastric acid secretion.

B. H2 blockers prevent release - This is partially correct. H2 blockers like cimetidine, ranitidine, etc., inhibit the release of gastric acid by blocking the action of histamine on the H2 receptors of parietal cells. However, they do not completely prevent the release.

C. Total acid output indicates parietal cell mass activity - This statement is true. Total acid output can be used as an indirect measure of parietal cell mass activity, as the number of parietal cells determines the amount of acid the stomach can produce.

Given the analysis, the most accurate and complete statement is C. However, H2 blockers do play a role in preventing acid release, even though it’s not a complete prevention. Since we are to select the best single answer, we choose the most accurate one.

A. Hematogenous through poal vein: While it is true that bacteria can spread to the liver via the bloodstream, the poal vein is not the most common route for pyogenic liver abscesses. Typically, the portal vein is involved, but the term ""poal"" is incorrect here. The correct term is ""portal.""

B. Ascending infection through biliary tract: This is a very common route for pyogenic liver abscesses. Biliary tract infections, such as cholangitis, can lead to abscess formation in the liver.

C. Hepatic artery: Infections through the hepatic artery are less common compared to the biliary tract.

D. Local spread: While local spread can occur, it is not the most common route for pyogenic liver abscesses.

Given this analysis, the most common route of spread for pyogenic liver abscesses is through the biliary tract.

A. Anemia: Anemia can be more common in multipara women due to multiple pregnancies and potential iron loss through menstruation and childbirth.

B. Placenta Previa: This condition, where the placenta is partially or completely covering the cervix, is more common in multipara women because the scar tissue from previous cesarean sections or placental implantation can lead to this condition.

C. PIH (Preeclampsia): Preeclampsia is actually more common in primipara women (first-time mothers) than in multipara women. Studies show that women who have had at least one previous pregnancy are at a slightly lower risk of developing preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.

D. None of the above: This option would only be correct if all the conditions were equally common in both multipara and primipara women, which is not the case.

1. **Diagnosis**: The presence of flask-shaped ulcers in the sigmoid colon strongly suggests **ulcerative colitis**. Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by continuous inflammation and ulceration of the colon and rectum, often presenting as ulcers with a characteristic flask shape.

2. **Treatment Options**:
   - **A. Intravenous ceftriaxone**: This is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and is not typically used for inflammatory bowel diseases.
   - **B. Intravenous metronidazole**: This is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal medication, often used for anaerobic infections, but not primary for inflammatory bowel diseases.
   - **C. Intravenous steroids and sulphasalazine**: Intravenous steroids (such as methylprednisolone) and sulphasalazine (an anti-inflammatory drug) are commonly used to control inflammation in ulcerative colitis. Methylprednisolone reduces inflammation, and sulphasalazine helps in controlling the mucosal inflammation.
   - **D. Hydrocoisone enemas**: Hydrocortisone enemas are used for localized inflammation in the colon, but intravenous administration would be less effective for widespread inflammation.

Given the context, the most appropriate treatment for ulcerative colitis would be a combination of intravenous steroids and sulphasalazine to manage the inflammation.

A. High-pitched decrescendo diastolic murmur: This type of murmur is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. The blood flows back into the left ventricle during diastole, creating a high-pitched, decrescendo (decreasing in loudness) murmur.

B. Soft, low pitched mid-diastolic rumbling murmur: This type of murmur is more consistent with mitral regurgitation or mitral valve prolapse, where blood flows back into the left atrium through the incompetent mitral valve during diastole.

C. Mid-systolic ejection flow murmur: This type of murmur is more consistent with aortic stenosis, where the aortic valve is narrowed and impedes blood flow.

D. Pansystolic murmur: This type of murmur is often associated with mitral regurgitation, where blood flows back into the left atrium throughout the systole.

Given that aortic regurgitation produces a high-pitched decrescendo diastolic murmur, options B, C, and D do not align with the typical findings of aortic regurgitation. However, a soft, low-pitched mid-diastolic rumbling murmur is most inconsistent with aortic regurgitation and is more characteristic of mitral regurgitation or mitral valve prolapse.

767,When the patient fails to understand normal speech but can understand shouted or amplified speech the hearing loss is termed as,"['Mild hearing loss', 'Moderate hearing loss', 'Severe hearing loss', 'Profound hearing loss']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the nature of the hearing loss described. The patient is having difficulty understanding normal speech but can understand shouted or amplified speech. This suggests that the patient has a hearing loss that affects their ability to hear softer sounds but not as much with louder sounds. This type of hearing loss is typically associated with conductive hearing loss or a mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss, where the outer or middle ear structures might be partially affected.

Given the options:
A. Mild hearing loss - This would generally imply a slight hearing loss affecting the ability to hear softer sounds, but the patient's ability to understand shouting indicates a more significant issue.
B. Moderate hearing loss - This fits the description well as it would affect the ability to hear softer sounds while still allowing some understanding of louder speech.
C. Severe hearing loss - This would likely prevent the patient from understanding any speech, even shouted.
D. Profound hearing loss - This would also prevent the patient from understanding any speech, even shouted.

The description aligns best with a moderate hearing loss, where the patient struggles with normal speech but can understand louder speech.

What is the most probable diagnosis -","['Acute Epiglottitis', 'Laryngotracheobronchitis', 'Foreign body aspiration', 'Retropharyngeal abscess']","Let's analyze the scenario step by step:

1. **History of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URI):** The patient has a history of a URI, which suggests an inflammatory process.
2. **Stridor:** Stridor is a high-pitched, wheezing sound heard during breathing, often due to upper airway obstruction.
3. **Decrease in Stridor on Lying Down Position:** This is a key point. Stridor that decreases when the child lies down suggests that the obstruction is not fixed and can change position. This is characteristic of conditions where the airway obstruction is dynamic, such as in croup (laryngotracheobronchitis).

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A. Acute Epiglottitis:** This condition presents with a high fever, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. Stridor is less likely to decrease on lying down.
- **B. Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup):** This condition often presents with a barking cough and stridor, and the stridor typically decreases when the child is in the sitting or upright position and worsens when lying down. However, the problem states that the stridor decreases on lying down, which is the opposite of what is expected in croup.
- **C. Foreign Body Aspiration:** This would cause stridor that is typically constant and does not change position. Additionally, the history of a URI is less common in cases of foreign body aspiration.
- **D. Retropharyngeal Abscess:** This condition presents with a high fever, difficulty swallowing, and stridor that is not position-dependent. The stridor would not decrease on lying down.

Given the history and the observation that the stridor decreases on lying down, the most probable diagnosis is Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup).

788,A 70-year-old man comes to casualty with urinary retention and back pain. Which investigation should be performed -,"['Serum acid phosphatase', 'Serum Calcium', 'Serum alkaline phosphatase', 'Serum electrophoresis']","To determine the appropriate investigation for a 70-year-old man presenting with urinary retention and back pain, we need to consider the potential causes of these symptoms. Urinary retention can be caused by several conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract obstruction, or prostate cancer. Back pain, especially in older men, can be associated with skeletal issues like bone metastases or spinal fractures. 

Serum acid phosphatase (A) is often used to screen for prostate cancer, as elevated levels can indicate the presence of prostate cancer. Serum calcium (B) can help in diagnosing metabolic bone diseases or hyperparathyroidism. Serum alkaline phosphatase (C) can be elevated in liver disease, bone diseases, or obstruction of the bile ducts. Serum electrophoresis (D) is used to identify abnormalities in the proteins, which can be useful in diagnosing multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.

Given the symptoms of urinary retention and back pain, the most relevant test would be one that can help rule out prostate cancer, as urinary retention can be a sign of benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer, and back pain can be related to skeletal conditions that can be detected by acid phosphatase levels.

A. Neuropraxia: This is the mildest form of nerve injury where the nerve fibers are temporarily disrupted due to compression or mechanical stress. The myelin sheath is intact, and the axons remain functional. This condition usually has a good prognosis as the nerve function can return quickly.

B. Axonotemesis: This type of injury involves damage to the axons (nerve fibers) and the endoneurial tubes, but the epineurium, perineurium, and nerve sheath are intact. Recovery is slower and less complete compared to neuropraxia, as the axons need to regenerate.

C. Neurotemesis: This is not a recognized medical term. It might be a misspelling or a misunderstanding. Given the context, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

D. Complete transaction: This refers to a complete severing of the nerve, where both the axons and the nerve sheath are completely disrupted. This results in the most severe form of nerve injury with the poorest prognosis, as the nerve must regenerate from scratch and can often result in permanent loss of function.

Considering the severity and prognosis of each type of nerve injury, neuropraxia has the best prognosis.

790,Investigation of choice for esophageal rupture is,"['Dynamic MRI', 'Rigid esophagoscopy', 'Barium contrast swallow', 'Water soluble low molecular weight contrast swallow']","To determine the correct investigation for esophageal rupture, we need to consider the characteristics and utility of each option:

A. Dynamic MRI: While MRI can provide detailed images, it is not typically the first-line investigation for acute esophageal rupture because it is expensive, time-consuming, and not readily available in all settings.

B. Rigid esophagoscopy: This is a direct visualization method but can cause further injury if the esophagus is already ruptured, making it risky in cases of suspected esophageal rupture.

C. Barium contrast swallow: This investigation can be helpful in detecting strictures, perforations, or leaks, but it may not be sensitive enough to detect small tears or to differentiate between a perforation and a stricture.

D. Water-soluble low molecular weight contrast swallow: This is a minimally invasive and safe investigation that can effectively detect leaks or perforations in the esophagus without the risk of further injury.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate and safe investigation for esophageal rupture is the water-soluble low molecular weight contrast swallow.

792,All of the following heart sounds occur shortly after S2 except,"['Opening snap', 'Pericardial knock', 'Ejection click', 'Tumor plop']","To determine which heart sound occurs shortly after S2, we need to understand the timing and nature of each sound:

- S2 is the second heart sound, which marks the end of ventricular contraction and the beginning of ventricular diastole.
- Opening snap is a sound heard during early diastole and is often associated with mitral valve prolapse.
- Pericardial knock is heard shortly after S2 and is a low-pitched sound, often heard in pericarditis.
- Ejection click is a sound heard during systole, not diastole.
- Tumor plop is a sound heard during diastole, often associated with a mobile left atrial thrombus or other left atrial masses.

Given this information, the sound that does not occur shortly after S2 is the ejection click, as it is heard during systole.

794,Elaboration of inactivating enzymes are the impoant mechanism of drug resistance among all of these antibiotics except,"['Quinolone', 'Pencillin', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Aminoglycoside']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each antibiotic option in the context of its mechanism of resistance.

A. Quinolones: Resistance in quinolones can arise through several mechanisms, including the production of enzymes that modify the quinolone drugs, such as DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are the primary targets of quinolones. This is a common mechanism of resistance for quinolones.

B. Penicillins: Penicillins are typically resistant to enzymes called beta-lactamases, which hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring of the penicillin molecule, rendering it inactive. This is a primary mechanism of resistance for penicillins.

C. Chloramphenicol: Resistance to chloramphenicol can occur through the production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, an inactivating enzyme that acetylates the drug, making it inactive. This is a common mechanism of resistance.

D. Aminoglycosides: Resistance to aminoglycosides can be due to several mechanisms, including modification of the drug by enzymes such as aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, but this is not the primary mechanism. More commonly, resistance arises from ribosomal protection proteins that shield the ribosome from the drug's action.

Given this information, the aminoglycosides do not primarily rely on the production of inactivating enzymes as the main mechanism of resistance.

796,Abnormal function of epithelial chloride channel protein is the cause of,"['Ehlers Danlos syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome', 'Cystic fibrosis', 'Diabetes insipidus']","To answer this question, we need to understand what each condition involves. 

- **Ehlers Danlos syndrome (Option A)** is a group of genetic disorders that affect connective tissue, leading to hypermobile joints and fragile skin. It is not related to chloride channel proteins.

- **Marfan syndrome (Option B)** is a genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue. It primarily affects the cardiovascular system and can cause issues with the heart and blood vessels. It is not related to chloride channel proteins.

- **Cystic fibrosis (Option C)** is a genetic disorder that affects the exocrine glands, leading to the production of thick, sticky mucus that can obstruct the lungs and lead to severe lung infections. This condition is caused by mutations in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene, which codes for a chloride channel protein. 

- **Diabetes insipidus (Option D)** is a condition characterized by excessive thirst and urination. It is caused by a deficiency in the production or action of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), not by abnormalities in chloride channel proteins.

Based on the above explanations, the abnormal function of epithelial chloride channel protein is the cause of Cystic fibrosis.

799,Dobutamine differs from dopamine in that,"['It has good blood-brain barrier penetrability', 'It causes pronounced tachycardia', 'It does not activate adrenergic b receptors', 'It does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the pharmacological actions of dobutamine and dopamine.

- **Dobutamine**: This is a selective beta-1 adrenergic agonist. It primarily stimulates the beta-1 receptors, which are mainly found in the heart. This leads to an increase in cardiac output and heart rate, but with minimal effects on peripheral vasculature.

- **Dopamine**: Dopamine has multiple actions depending on the concentration. At low concentrations, it activates dopaminergic receptors and has effects on renal blood flow and renal function. At higher concentrations, it activates beta-1 receptors, leading to increased cardiac output, and also alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A. **It has good blood-brain barrier penetrability**: Dobutamine does not have significant blood-brain barrier penetrability, whereas dopamine can cross the blood-brain barrier, especially at higher concentrations.

B. **It causes pronounced tachycardia**: Dobutamine does cause tachycardia as a primary effect due to its action on the beta-1 receptors in the heart.

C. **It does not activate adrenergic b receptors**: Dobutamine specifically activates beta-1 receptors but not beta-2 or beta-3 receptors.

D. **It does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors**: This is not accurate because dobutamine does not act on peripheral dopaminergic receptors; it primarily acts on beta-1 receptors.

The correct statement is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors.

Hanup disease is not a standard medical term, but it seems to refer to Phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder where phenylalanine cannot be properly metabolized and accumulates in the body.

- **Option A: Burnt sugar smell in urine** - This is a characteristic smell associated with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), not PKU.
- **Option B: High plasma phenylalanine levels** - This is a key feature of PKU. People with PKU have elevated levels of phenylalanine in their blood.
- **Option C: Extremely high levels of citrulline in urine** - This is more indicative of citrullinemia, another metabolic disorder.
- **Option D: High fecal levels of tryptophan and indole derivatives** - This is more characteristic of tyrosinemia or other conditions affecting tryptophan metabolism.

Given these points, the correct answer is the one that matches the key clinical observation of PKU.

803,Biological value of a protein is related to,"['Nitrogen content', 'amino acid content', 'Sulphur content', 'Energy content']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what biological value means in the context of proteins. The biological value (BV) of a protein measures the proportion of absorbed protein that becomes incorporated into the proteins of the body. It is particularly concerned with how well the protein can be used by the body.

Let's analyze each option:

A. Nitrogen content: While nitrogen is a key component of proteins, the biological value is not solely based on nitrogen content. It involves more than just the amount of nitrogen.

B. Amino acid content: The biological value of a protein is closely related to its amino acid profile, particularly its essential amino acid content and whether it can meet the body's needs. The quality and availability of these amino acids are crucial for protein synthesis.

C. Sulphur content: Sulphur content is a specific aspect of amino acids, but it does not encompass the overall biological value of a protein.

D. Energy content: The biological value of a protein does not relate to its energy content. Proteins are not primarily used for energy production.

Given this reasoning, the correct answer is the one that best aligns with the concept of how well a protein can be used by the body, which is most directly related to its amino acid content.

A. Case-Control Study: This type of study compares individuals with a disease (cases) to those without the disease (controls) to identify possible risk factors. It is useful for studying rare diseases and risk factors but may not provide detailed information about the long-term outcomes or progression of the disease.

B. Cohort Study: This study involves following a group of individuals over time, tracking the development of a disease in relation to potential risk factors. It is particularly useful for understanding the long-term effects and risk factors of diseases.

C. Cross-Sectional Study: This type of study assesses the health status of a population at a single point in time. It can help identify the prevalence of a disease but does not provide information about the development or progression over time.

D. Case Report: This is a detailed report of a single case, which is not suitable for studying correlations or trends in a population.

807,Alternating RBBB with Left anterior hemiblock is seen in,"[""1' degree hea block"", 'Complete hea block', 'Mobitz type II block', 'Bi-fascicular block']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the medical condition mentioned in the question: ""Alternating RBBB with Left anterior hemiblock.""

- **Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB):** This is a conduction disturbance where the right bundle branch is affected, leading to a characteristic ECG pattern.
- **Left Anterior Hemiblock:** This is a conduction disturbance where the left bundle branch is affected, specifically the left anterior fascicle, leading to another characteristic ECG pattern.
- **Alternating:** This implies that the ECG alternates between the patterns of RBBB and Left Anterior Hemiblock.

Now, let's consider each option:

A. **1st degree heart block:** This is characterized by a prolonged PR interval, but it does not cause alternation between RBBB and Left Anterior Hemiblock.
B. **Complete heart block:** This involves a total block in the conduction system, often resulting in a third-degree heart block and not alternating patterns of RBBB and Left Anterior Hemiblock.
C. **Mobitz type II block:** This is a form of second-degree heart block, where the conduction is progressively delayed and eventually fails, not leading to alternating patterns.
D. **Bi-fascicular block:** This is a condition where two of the three fascicles (right bundle branch and either the left anterior or left posterior fascicle) are blocked, which can lead to alternating patterns of RBBB and Left Anterior or Left Posterior Hemiblock.

Given the context of alternating patterns, the most appropriate condition is a bi-fascicular block, where two of the three fascicles are blocked, leading to the observed alternation.

808,A patient presents with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and presence of urobilinogen in urine. Which amongst the following is the least likely diagnosis -,"['Hemolytic jaundice', 'Crigler Najjar syndrome', ""Gilbert's syndrome"", 'Dubin Johnson syndrome']","To determine the least likely diagnosis, let's analyze the characteristics of each condition given the patient's presentation of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and presence of urobilinogen in the urine.

1. **Hemolytic Jaundice (Option A)**: This condition is characterized by increased bilirubin due to excessive breakdown of red blood cells. The unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a hallmark of this condition, and since bilirubin is filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine, urobilinogen should be present in the urine. This makes hemolytic jaundice a likely diagnosis.

2. **Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Option B)**: This is a severe form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to a deficiency in the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The patient would present with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and, typically, no urobilinogen in the urine because the liver's ability to conjugate bilirubin is severely impaired, leading to a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin. This makes Crigler Najjar syndrome less likely as it would not present with urobilinogen in the urine.

3. **Gilbert's Syndrome (Option C)**: This is a mild form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to reduced activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The patient may have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and urobilinogen in the urine, as the liver still has some capacity to conjugate bilirubin. This makes Gilbert's syndrome a likely diagnosis.

4. **Dubin Johnson Syndrome (Option D)**: This condition is characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to a defect in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile. The patient would not typically present with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and urobilinogen in the urine. This makes Dubin Johnson syndrome unlikely given the patient’s presentation.

The least likely diagnosis, given the patient's presentation, is Dubin Johnson syndrome.

A. Depend on laminar flow for their accuracy - Rotameters do indeed rely on laminar flow to provide accurate measurements. Turbulent flow can lead to inaccurate readings.

B. Will only function when upright - Rotameters are designed to be used in an upright position, but they can function in other orientations with reduced accuracy, not that they will not function at all.

C. Are constant pressure drop-constant orifice devices - Rotameters operate based on a constant orifice principle, where the height of the float within the tapered tube corresponds to the flow rate, and the pressure drop remains constant.

D. Are not accurate below 1L/min - Rotameters are generally more accurate at higher flow rates and may not provide accurate readings at very low flow rates, but there isn't a fixed threshold of 1L/min below which they are not accurate.

Given these points, the most accurate description of rotameters is that they are constant pressure drop-constant orifice devices, which aligns with option C.

1. **DNA Repair**: The p53 gene does play a role in DNA repair by activating repair mechanisms when DNA damage is detected. However, this is not the primary mechanism by which p53 prevents cancer.

2. **Cell Cycle Arrest**: When DNA damage is severe or cannot be repaired, p53 can halt the cell cycle to allow time for repair or to prevent the cell from dividing with damaged DNA, which could lead to mutations and cancer.

3. **Apoptosis Induction**: If DNA damage is too severe and cannot be repaired, p53 can initiate programmed cell death (apoptosis) to prevent the propagation of damaged cells that could potentially become cancerous.

4. **All of the Above**: Given that p53 can perform all these functions, it is accurate to say that p53 prevents carcinoma by all of these mechanisms.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","['MEN type I', 'MEN type II', 'MEN type III', ""Sipple's syndrome""]","To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the provided information and the characteristics of each Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type.

1. **MEN type I**: Characterized by primary hyperparathyroidism, pituitary adenomas, and/or non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. It does not typically involve medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma, or mucosal neuromas.

2. **MEN type II**: This is divided into MEN2A and MEN2B.
   - **MEN2A**: Typically involves medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia (or adenoma). It may also include mucosal neuromas. However, primary hyperparathyroidism is not a typical feature.
   - **MEN2B**: Similar to MEN2A but includes additional features like mucosal neuromas, pheochromocytoma, and Marfanoid habitus.

3. **MEN type III**: This is rare and involves MTC and pheochromocytoma, but it does not typically include parathyroid involvement.

4. **Sipple's syndrome**: This is a specific form of MEN2A where there is a combination of medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. However, the patient in this case does not have primary hyperparathyroidism.

1. **Short stature**: This could suggest a condition affecting growth, such as Turner syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome.
2. **Wide spread nipples**: This is a common feature in Turner syndrome, where the breast tissue is more developed.
3. **Primary amenorrhoea**: This indicates that the individual has not had a menstrual period, which is a hallmark of Turner syndrome.

Now, let's look at the karyotypes provided:

- **47, XX + 18**: This indicates a trisomy (three copies) of chromosome 18, which is not typically associated with the symptoms described.
- **46XXXY**: This karyotype is associated with Klinefelter syndrome, which does not usually present with short stature and primary amenorrhoea in females.
- **47, XXY**: This is the correct karyotype for Klinefelter syndrome, which can cause short stature, gynecomastia (widely spread nipples), and primary amenorrhoea.
- **45 XO**: This is the karyotype for Turner syndrome, which does match the symptoms of short stature, wide spread nipples, and primary amenorrhoea.

Given the symptoms and the karyotypes, the most likely karyotype is Turner syndrome (45 XO).

A. Claw hand is never seen - This is incorrect. Klumpke's paralysis, which results from injury to the lower trunk of the brachial plexus, often leads to claw hand due to the paralysis of the intrinsic muscles of the hand and the loss of the extensor muscles, leading to a claw-like deformity.

B. Intrinsics muscles of hand are paralysed - This is correct. Klumpke's paralysis involves the lower brachial plexus, which innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand, leading to their paralysis.

C. Horner's syndrome can be associated - This is correct. Klumpke's paralysis can also involve the sympathetic fibers that run in the lower trunk of the brachial plexus, leading to Horner's syndrome, which includes ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (absence of sweating) on the affected side.

D. Involves lower trunk of brachial plexus - This is correct. Klumpke's paralysis specifically involves injury to the lower trunk of the brachial plexus.

826,Inheritance of ABO blood group is:,"['X-linked inheritance', 'Recessive inheritance', 'Mitochondria] inheritance', 'Codominance']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of ABO blood group inheritance:

A. X-linked inheritance: This pattern of inheritance is typically seen when a gene is located on the X chromosome. The ABO blood group is not located on the X chromosome, so this option can be ruled out.

B. Recessive inheritance: In recessive inheritance, an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent) to express the trait. However, the ABO blood group is expressed even when an individual has only one dominant allele, which is not consistent with recessive inheritance.

C. Mitochondria inheritance: This pattern of inheritance is associated with mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down maternally. The ABO blood group is encoded by genes on chromosome 9, not in the mitochondria.

D. Codominance: This is the correct pattern for the ABO blood group. In codominance, both alleles are expressed equally when present in the heterozygous state. For example, an individual with genotype IAIB will have type AB blood, with both A and B antigens expressed.

828,Decreased basal metabolic rate is seen in,"['Obesity', 'Hypehyroidism', 'Feeding', 'Exercise']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A. Obesity: While obesity is often associated with metabolic conditions, it does not directly cause a decreased basal metabolic rate. In fact, obesity can sometimes be linked with increased metabolic activity due to the presence of excess adipose tissue.

B. Hyperthyroidism: This condition is characterized by an overactive thyroid gland, leading to an increased metabolic rate, not a decreased one.

C. Feeding: Feeding or eating increases metabolic rate as the body uses energy to digest and process food. It does not cause a decreased basal metabolic rate.

D. Exercise: Exercise increases metabolic rate by increasing the body's need for energy, thus not leading to a decreased basal metabolic rate.

The condition that is associated with a decreased basal metabolic rate is a state of starvation or undernutrition, but since this option is not provided, the closest logical fit among the given options is not present. However, based on the options provided, none directly indicate a decrease in basal metabolic rate, but if we consider the context of the question and the need to choose, none of the provided options (A, B, C, or D) correctly describe a situation where the basal metabolic rate would be decreased.

829,"A 25 year male presented with high grade fever, headache, neck stiffness, on examination found to have neck rigidity, kernig's sign positive, csf analysis showed neutrophilic predominance, low glucose and limulus amebocyte lysate assay was positive. Which of the following is the likely pathogen?","['Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus pneumonia', 'Neisseria meningitides', 'Listeria monocytogenes']","Let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has high-grade fever, headache, and neck stiffness, indicating a possible infectious process affecting the central nervous system.
2. **Neurological Examination**: Neck rigidity and a positive Kernig's sign suggest meningitis.
3. **CSF Analysis**:
   - Neutrophilic predominance: This indicates a polymicrobial or bacterial infection, as neutrophils are typically the first responders to bacterial infections.
   - Low glucose: Bacterial meningitis often leads to a decrease in glucose levels in CSF, as bacteria consume glucose for energy.
   - Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay positive: This test is used to detect endotoxins, which are produced by Gram-negative bacteria. A positive result strongly suggests a bacterial cause.

Given these details, we need to identify the most likely bacterial pathogen:

- **Staphylococcus aureus (A)**: While it can cause meningitis, it is less common and typically presents with more localized infections and less frequently with a neutrophilic predominance in CSF.
- **Streptococcus pneumonia (B)**: This can cause meningitis, but it usually presents with a predominance of lymphocytes in CSF, not neutrophils.
- **Neisseria meningitidis (C)**: This is a common cause of bacterial meningitis, especially in young adults, and it can present with a neutrophilic predominance, low glucose, and can be detected by LAL.
- **Listeria monocytogenes (D)**: Although it can cause meningitis, it is more common in immunocompromised individuals and usually presents with a lymphocytic predominance in CSF rather than neutrophils.

Considering all the clinical and laboratory findings, **Neisseria meningitidis** is the most likely pathogen.

830,All of the followings are responsible for Right shifting of O2 saturation curve; except:,"['Hypoxia', 'Hypocapnia', 'Increase temp', 'Increased 2,3 DPG']","To determine which option does not contribute to the right shifting of the O2 saturation curve, let's review each option:

A. Hypoxia: Hypoxia can lead to an increase in the production of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), which shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. Therefore, hypoxia can be a cause of the right shift.

B. Hypocapnia: Hypocapnia (low levels of CO2) can also lead to a right shift in the oxygen dissociation curve due to a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. This is because hypocapnia stimulates the respiratory center, leading to increased breathing and a lower pH, which in turn increases the concentration of carbonic acid and hydrogen ions, reducing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.

C. Increase temp: An increase in temperature also shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. Higher temperatures increase the rate of dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin, making it easier for oxygen to be released to tissues.

D. Increased 2,3 DPG: As mentioned, increased 2,3-DPG levels directly shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the right by lowering the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.

Given that all of these factors (hypoxia, hypocapnia, increased temperature, and increased 2,3-DPG) can cause a right shift in the O2 saturation curve, we need to identify the one that does not contribute to this shift. Among the options, hypoxia is actually a cause of the right shift, not a factor that would prevent it. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that does not lead to a right shift.

What will be cause?","['Phase II block', 'Succinylcholine causes muscle paralysis due to fasciculation', 'Hidden muscle dystrophy', 'Pseudo cholinesterase deficiency']","Let's analyze the options given the context:

- **Option A: Phase II block** - This is a known complication of repeated administration of succinylcholine, where the muscle paralysis persists even after the effects of succinylcholine have waned. This can lead to respiratory failure and paralysis of the lower limbs.

- **Option B: Succinylcholine causes muscle paralysis due to fasciculation** - While succinylcholine can cause fasciculation (muscle twitching) as a side effect, it does not typically cause persistent paralysis and respiratory failure.

- **Option C: Hidden muscle dystrophy** - This is a condition where the muscle function is affected due to a structural or metabolic problem. However, it is not typically caused by succinylcholine administration.

- **Option D: Pseudo cholinesterase deficiency** - This would affect the breakdown of succinylcholine, but the symptoms described do not match the typical presentation of this condition. The symptoms would more likely be prolonged paralysis without the acute respiratory failure described.

Given the scenario where the patient has received a large dose of succinylcholine and is now experiencing respiratory failure and paralysis, the most likely cause is Phase II block.

A. Dobutamine decreases peripheral resistance - Dobutamine is a beta-adrenergic agonist that primarily increases cardiac output by stimulating the heart's beta-1 receptors. It does not typically decrease peripheral resistance; rather, it can increase it due to the increased heart rate and contractility.

B. Acts on D1 and D2 receptors - Dobutamine does not act on D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. It primarily acts on beta-adrenergic receptors.

C. Decrease kidney circulation - Dobutamine can increase renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, so it does not decrease kidney circulation.

D. Has no effect on coronary circulation - Dobutamine actually has a positive effect on coronary circulation by increasing coronary blood flow, which is beneficial for myocardial perfusion.

Given this information, the correct statement about dobutamine is that it has a positive effect on coronary circulation.

A. Perform nutritive function: Cutaneous shunt vessels are not primarily involved in nutrient transport or nutritive function. Their primary role is to regulate blood flow and thus manage heat loss or gain.

B. Have role in thermoregulation: Cutaneous shunt vessels do play a crucial role in thermoregulation. When the body temperature is high, these vessels dilate (dilatation) to increase blood flow near the skin surface, promoting heat loss and cooling the body. Conversely, when the body is cold, these vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) to reduce blood flow to the skin and maintain core body temperature.

C. Not under the control of autonomic nervous system: Cutaneous shunt vessels are actually under the control of the autonomic nervous system, which can dilate or constrict them based on the body's temperature needs.

D. These vessels are evenly distributed throughout the skin: Cutaneous shunt vessels are not evenly distributed. They are more prevalent in certain areas of the skin, such as the palms, soles, and fingertips, where they are needed to manage heat loss effectively.

Given this analysis, the correct statement about cutaneous shunt vessels is that they have a role in thermoregulation.

847,NOT a cause of granular contracted kidney ?,"['Diabetes mellitus', 'Chronic pyelonephritis', 'Benign nephrosclerosis', 'Chronic glomerulonephritis']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what a granular contracted kidney is. A granular contracted kidney is a characteristic appearance of the kidney in advanced, chronic kidney disease. It often results from long-term damage to the kidney tissue.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A. Diabetes mellitus - This can cause chronic kidney disease, leading to a granular contracted kidney appearance due to diabetic nephropathy.

B. Chronic pyelonephritis - This condition involves repeated or chronic infection of the kidney, which can lead to scarring and a granular contracted kidney.

C. Benign nephrosclerosis - This condition is characterized by the hardening of the arteries in the kidney, leading to reduced blood flow and subsequent kidney damage. Over time, this can result in a granular contracted kidney.

D. Chronic glomerulonephritis - This is a condition involving inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys, which can cause scarring and the development of a granular contracted kidney.

Given these explanations, all the conditions listed can potentially lead to a granular contracted kidney. However, the question asks which is NOT a cause. Since all the conditions listed can lead to a granular contracted kidney, we need to identify the one that is least directly associated with the granular contracted kidney appearance. 

Chronic pyelonephritis, while leading to scarring, is more directly associated with infection and inflammation, whereas the other conditions (diabetes mellitus, benign nephrosclerosis, and chronic glomerulonephritis) are more directly associated with chronic damage and scarring leading to the granular contracted appearance.

850,"In respiratory and GIT infections, which is the most affected immunoglobulin -","['IgA', 'IgG', 'IgM', 'IgD']","To determine which immunoglobulin is most affected in respiratory and GIT (gastrointestinal tract) infections, we need to consider the role and distribution of each type of immunoglobulin in the body.

- **IgA**: This is the predominant immunoglobulin found in mucosal secretions such as saliva, tears, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. It plays a crucial role in providing localized immunity.
- **IgG**: This is the most abundant immunoglobulin in the blood and is also present in other body fluids. It is important for systemic immunity and can cross the placenta to provide passive immunity to the fetus.
- **IgM**: This is the first immunoglobulin produced in response to a new infection and is found in the blood and lymph. It is not as prevalent in mucosal secretions.
- **IgD**: This immunoglobulin is present in low levels in the serum and is not as directly involved in mucosal immunity.

Given the roles of these immunoglobulins, **IgA** is the most abundant in mucosal secretions and thus plays a critical role in defending the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts against infections.

851,Hypercalcemia is most commonly associated in which of the following cancers?,"['Renal cell cancer', 'Carcinoma stomach', 'Squamous cell carcinoma of lung', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to its association with hypercalcemia:

A. Renal cell cancer: This cancer can cause hypercalcemia due to the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by the tumor cells, which mimics the effects of parathyroid hormone and increases calcium levels in the blood.

B. Carcinoma stomach: This type of cancer does not typically cause hypercalcemia as its primary mechanism of action is related to the secretion of gastric acid and does not usually involve the production of PTHrP.

C. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung: This cancer can cause hypercalcemia through the secretion of PTHrP, but it is not as commonly associated with hypercalcemia as renal cell cancer.

D. Hepatocellular carcinoma: This liver cancer primarily causes hypercalcemia due to vitamin D metabolites and calcitonin, but it is less frequently associated with hypercalcemia compared to renal cell cancer.

Considering these points, renal cell cancer is the most common cancer associated with hypercalcemia.

It is appropriate in all except,"['Transformation zone lying entirely on ectocervix.', 'Smooth cervical surface without deep crevices.', 'Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia -3.', 'CIN limited to two quadrants of the cervix.']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of cryosurgery for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN):

A. Transformation zone lying entirely on ectocervix: The transformation zone is the area where squamous and columnar epithelium meet, and it is a common site for cervical dysplasia. Cryosurgery can be used effectively here as it can target the affected area precisely.

B. Smooth cervical surface without deep crevices: A smooth cervical surface without deep crevices is a favorable condition for cryosurgery because it allows for better application and visualization of the treatment area. This option is generally suitable.

C. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia -3: CIN-3, also known as severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ, is a serious condition that may require more aggressive treatment. Cryosurgery can be used for CIN-3, but it may not be the most appropriate or effective treatment in all cases, particularly when more extensive or severe cases are present.

D. CIN limited to two quadrants of the cervix: This option describes a localized area of CIN, which is a suitable target for cryosurgery. The procedure can be tailored to the specific area affected.

Given the context, the most appropriate scenario for cryosurgery is when the lesion is localized and the cervical surface is smooth, allowing for precise application. CIN-3, while treatable with cryosurgery, might not always be the most appropriate option due to the severity of the condition, which may require more targeted or extensive treatment.

This condition can cause symptoms such as vomiting, poor feeding, convulsions, and psychomotor retardation, as well as physical features like microcephaly and distinctive skin rashes. The musty odor of urine is also a known feature of PKU, as phenylalanine is converted to phenylketones, which are excreted in the urine.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. May be caused due to the deficiency of cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin BH4
- This statement is true. PKU can be due to a deficiency in the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is necessary for phenylalanine hydroxylase to function properly.

B. Tandem mass spectrometry is useful in the diagnosis.
- This statement is true. Tandem mass spectrometry is a common and effective method used for newborn screening to diagnose PKU early.

C. The complications can't be prevented by restricting the use of the involved amino acid in diet.
- This statement is false. Restricting the intake of phenylalanine in the diet can prevent many of the complications associated with PKU, such as neurological damage and developmental delays.

873,Not a marker for hyperparathyroidism is :,"['Increase in serum calcium', 'Increase in 24 hour urinary calcium excretion', 'Decrease in serum calcitonin', 'Subperiosteal resorption of phalanges']","Let's analyze each option in the context of hyperparathyroidism:

A. Increase in serum calcium: Hyperparathyroidism typically results in increased serum calcium levels as the overactive parathyroid glands produce more parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases calcium reabsorption in the kidneys and promotes bone resorption.

B. Increase in 24 hour urinary calcium excretion: PTH also increases the excretion of calcium in the urine, so an increase in urinary calcium is expected in hyperparathyroidism.

C. Decrease in serum calcitonin: Calcitonin is produced by the C cells of the thyroid gland and works to lower blood calcium levels by promoting calcium excretion in the urine and inhibiting bone resorption. In hyperparathyroidism, the high calcium levels would likely lead to a decrease in calcitonin production as the body attempts to lower calcium levels.

D. Subperiosteal resorption of phalanges: This is a common finding in hyperparathyroidism due to the increased bone turnover and resorption caused by elevated PTH levels.

Given this information, the option that does not align with hyperparathyroidism is C.

875,Failure to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration following birth is clinically k/a –,"['Birth asphyxia', 'RDS–Respiratory distress syndrome', 'Respiratory failure', 'Pulmonary oedema']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the question and the options:

- **Question**: Failure to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration following birth is clinically known as –
- **Options**:
  - A. Birth asphyxia
  - B. RDS (Respiratory distress syndrome)
  - C. Respiratory failure
  - D. Pulmonary oedema

1. **Birth asphyxia** refers to a condition where there is a lack of oxygen during birth, which can affect the newborn's ability to breathe and maintain adequate oxygen levels in the body. While it can lead to breathing issues, the term specifically refers to the oxygen deprivation, not the failure to initiate respiration.

2. **RDS (Respiratory distress syndrome)** is a condition that typically affects premature babies, characterized by respiratory distress due to immature lung development. It focuses on the respiratory system's immaturity and does not directly address failure to initiate spontaneous respiration.

3. **Respiratory failure** is a broader term that describes the inability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen to the body or remove enough carbon dioxide. This can happen due to various reasons, including failure to initiate spontaneous respiration.

4. **Pulmonary oedema** refers to fluid accumulation in the lungs, often due to heart problems or other conditions that affect lung function. It is not directly related to the failure to initiate respiration.

Given that the question specifically asks about the failure to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration following birth, the most appropriate term is **respiratory failure**, as it encompasses the inability to breathe adequately.

876,Abdominal ultra-sonography in a 3 year old boy show a solid circumscribed hypoechnoic renal mass. Most likely diagnosis is -,"[""Wilm's tumor"", 'Renal cell carcinoma', 'Mesoblastic nephroma', 'Oncocytoma']","To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the given options based on the clinical scenario provided:

1. **Wilm's Tumor (Option A)**: This is the most common pediatric renal tumor, typically presenting in children under 5 years of age. It often appears as a solid, well-circumscribed, and hyperechoic mass on ultrasound, but it can also be hypoechogenic. The term ""hypoechogenic"" is more commonly used than ""hypoechinoic"" in medical imaging reports, so this aligns well with Wilm's Tumor.

2. **Renal Cell Carcinoma (Option B)**: This is a type of adult kidney cancer and is rare in children. It is usually a solid, irregular, and heterogeneous mass, not typically described as hypoechogenic or well-circumscribed in a young child.

3. **Mesoblastic Nephroma (Option C)**: This is a benign tumor that is more common in infants and young children. It can present as a solid, well-circumscribed, and hypoechoic mass, similar to Wilm's Tumor. However, it is generally considered a less common diagnosis in a 3-year-old compared to Wilm's Tumor.

4. **Oncocytoma (Option D)**: This is a benign renal tumor that is usually seen in adults and is characterized by a homogeneous echo pattern, which is different from the description given.

Given the age of the child (3 years old), the solid, well-circumscribed, and hypoechogenic nature of the mass, and the fact that Wilm's Tumor is the most common renal tumor in children, the most likely diagnosis is Wilm's Tumor.

1. **Persistent Diarrhea**: This symptom is characteristic of several conditions, but it's often associated with hormonal tumors that secrete hormones leading to increased bicarbonate reabsorption and subsequent fluid loss.

2. **Hypotension**: This is a common symptom in several conditions, including those where there is significant fluid loss or vasodilation.

3. **VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumor)**: This is a tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIP causes vasodilation and increased bicarbonate reabsorption in the colon, leading to persistent diarrhea and hypotension.

4. **ACTHoma (Pituitary Adenoma Secreting ACTH)**: This would typically cause Cushing's syndrome with features like weight gain, muscle weakness, and hypertension, not hypotension.

5. **GRFoma (Growth Hormone Releasing Factor Tumor)**: This would typically cause acromegaly or gigantism with features like enlarged extremities, coarsened facial features, and hypertension, not hypotension.

6. **Glucagonoma**: This tumor secretes glucagon, which can cause necrolytic migratory erythema, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. However, it is less commonly associated with hypotension compared to the other options.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is VIPoma, which directly links persistent diarrhea and hypotension.

A. Megaloblastic anemia - This condition typically presents with macrocytic anemia due to a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate. While it can cause pancytopenia, the bone marrow usually shows megaloblasts, which means the marrow is cellular. Thus, pancytopenia with cellular marrow is seen in megaloblastic anemia.

B. Myelodysplasia - Also known as dysplastic syndromes, these conditions are characterized by dysplastic changes in the bone marrow cells, leading to pancytopenia. The bone marrow is often cellular in these disorders. Therefore, pancytopenia with cellular marrow can be seen in myelodysplasia.

C. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) - This condition involves the destruction of red blood cells, leading to anemia, and can also affect white blood cells and platelets, causing pancytopenia. The bone marrow in PNH is typically cellular. Thus, pancytopenia with cellular marrow can be seen in PNH.

D. G6PD deficiency - This is a genetic disorder that affects the function of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, leading to hemolytic anemia. It does not typically cause pancytopenia, and the bone marrow response is usually reactive and hypercellular. Therefore, pancytopenia with cellular marrow is not expected in G6PD deficiency.

This suggests that the child's behavior (reading well) has been influenced by receiving a bicycle, which is a positive outcome or reward.

Positive reinforcement involves presenting a desirable stimulus (in this case, the bicycle) after a behavior (reading well) to increase the likelihood of that behavior being repeated in the future.

Negative reinforcement would involve removing an aversive stimulus to increase a behavior, which is not the case here.

Omission involves withholding a stimulus to decrease a behavior, which also does not apply here.

Punishment involves presenting an aversive stimulus to decrease a behavior, which is not the case here.

933,"What is approx fetal weight, if height of uterus is above pubic symphysis is 35 cm and station of head -2?","['2.5 kg', '3 kg', '3.5 kg', '4 kg']","To determine the approximate fetal weight based on the given parameters, let's break down the information:

1. The height of the uterus (fundal height) is 35 cm. Typically, the fundal height in centimeters corresponds to the gestational age in weeks during the second trimester and part of the third trimester. A fundal height of 35 cm is generally around 35-36 weeks of gestation.

2. The station of the head is -2, which means the fetal head is 2 cm above the level of the ischial spines (the level of the pelvis). A station of -2 is still considered pre engaged, which is common in this gestational age.

Using a fetal growth chart or formula, we can estimate the fetal weight at 35-36 weeks of gestation. Fetal weight typically increases from about 1 kg at 28 weeks to about 3.5-4 kg at 40 weeks. At 35-36 weeks, the fetal weight is usually around 3.25-3.75 kg.

Given the options:
A. 2.5 kg
B. 3 kg
C. 3.5 kg
D. 4 kg

The most accurate estimate from the provided options would be C. 3.5 kg.

934,Which is the cause of hemolysis in G6-PD deficiency?,"['Hemoglobin defect', 'Oxidative stress', 'Membrane defect', 'Vitamin B12 deficiency']","G6-PD deficiency is an enzyme deficiency that leads to increased susceptibility to hemolysis, particularly when exposed to oxidative stress. This is because the lack of G6-PD enzyme leads to a buildup of oxidative stress within red blood cells, which can cause damage and ultimately hemolysis.

Let's reason through the options:
A. Hemoglobin defect - This refers to abnormalities in the structure or production of hemoglobin itself, which is not the cause of hemolysis in G6-PD deficiency.
B. Oxidative stress - This is correct because G6-PD deficiency leads to an increased sensitivity of red blood cells to oxidative stress, which can trigger hemolysis.
C. Membrane defect - While membrane defects can cause hemolysis, G6-PD deficiency is not primarily due to a membrane defect.
D. Vitamin B12 deficiency - This is associated with different types of anemia, not specifically with G6-PD deficiency.

935,In case of hypothyroidism which investigation is most informative and most commonly used:,"['Serum TSH level', 'Serum T3 and T4 level', 'Serum calcitonin assay', 'Serum TRH assay']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A. Serum TSH level: Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormones. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland is underactive, leading to decreased production of T3 and T4, which in turn causes the pituitary to release more TSH in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid. Therefore, measuring TSH levels is a reliable indicator of thyroid function and can help diagnose hypothyroidism.

B. Serum T3 and T4 level: While these are directly related to thyroid function, they are less commonly used as the first-line diagnostic test because T3 and T4 levels can be normal in early hypothyroidism or can be affected by factors other than thyroid function, such as liver disease or medications.

C. Serum calcitonin assay: This test is more relevant for diagnosing conditions like medullary thyroid carcinoma and is not typically used to diagnose or monitor hypothyroidism.

D. Serum TRH assay: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced by the hypothalamus and stimulates the pituitary to release TSH. Measuring TRH levels is not a routine diagnostic test for hypothyroidism and is not as informative as TSH levels.

Given this reasoning, the most informative and commonly used investigation in case of hypothyroidism is the serum TSH level.

The options given are different stains and dyes used in microbiology. 

- Polychrome methylene blue (A) is used to stain spirochetes, but it is not commonly used for routine diagnosis.
- Carbol fuchsin (B) is a basic fuchsin dye used in the Ziehl-Neelsen stain for mycobacteria, which are not typically associated with abattoir injuries.
- Acid fast stain (C) is specifically used to identify acid-fast bacteria such as Mycobacterium species. Since abattoir injuries can sometimes result from Mycobacterium bovis (causing a disease called bovine tuberculosis), an acid fast stain would be useful.
- Calcofluor white (D) is used to identify fungi with fluorigenic properties but is not typically used for routine diagnosis of skin infections.

Given the context of an abattoir-related injury and the possibility of mycobacterial infection, the acid fast stain would be the most appropriate choice for diagnosis.

Which of the following cells is the germ cell closest to the basal lamina in the seminiferous tubule?,"['Primary spermatocyte', 'Secondary spermatocyte', 'Spermatid', 'Spermatogonia']","To answer this question, we need to understand the sequence of spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules. Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm production and involves several stages, starting with spermatogonia, which are the stem cells in the testis. As these cells undergo mitosis, they produce primary spermatocytes, which then undergo meiosis to become secondary spermatocytes. The secondary spermatocytes then divide to form spermatids, which eventually develop into sperm cells.

Given the scenario in the question, where there are only a few germ cells near the basal lamina in the seminiferous tubule, we can infer that these cells are the most primitive form of germ cells present, as they are closest to the basal lamina and have not yet undergone any differentiation or division that would move them further along in the spermatogenesis process. Spermatogonia, which are the stem cells, are typically found near the basal lamina.

C. CO poisoning: Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin, leading to tissue hypoxia. The body responds by increasing respiratory rate and depth to improve oxygen intake, which can lead to hyperventilation.

D. Increased adrenergic levels: This typically refers to an increase in adrenaline or other catecholamines. While this can increase heart rate and blood pressure, it does not directly cause hyperventilation. Instead, it can cause tachypnea (rapid breathing) but not necessarily hyperventilation, which is characterized by an increased rate and depth of breathing to the point of reducing CO2 levels in the blood.

A. Infertility: While Crohn's disease can affect various organs and systems, it is not typically associated with infertility. Infertility can be related to other factors such as age, lifestyle, and other medical conditions. Therefore, infertility is not a standard complication of Crohn's disease.

B. Risk of Ca: This likely refers to cancer risk. Crohn's disease does increase the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer and cancer of the small intestine. Thus, this statement is true.

C. Medical treatment includes antibiotics, probiotics, and TNF alpha blockers: These are indeed used in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Antibiotics can be used to treat infections, probiotics are used to improve gut flora, and TNF alpha blockers are biologic drugs that help reduce inflammation. This statement is also true.

D. ASCA-negative: Antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are used to diagnose and monitor certain autoimmune diseases, and the presence or absence of ANCA can be relevant. However, ASCA (anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies) are not typically used to diagnose Crohn's disease. The presence or absence of ASCA is not a standard diagnostic criterion for the disease. Thus, this statement is not true in the context of Crohn's disease diagnosis and treatment.

963,A child brought to casualty with reports of violent shaking by parents. The most likely injury is?,"['Long bone fracture', 'Ruptured spleen', 'Subdural haematoma', 'Skull bone fracture']","To determine the most likely injury in a child with reports of violent shaking, we need to consider the typical injuries associated with non-accidental trauma, often referred to as shaken baby syndrome. Violent shaking can lead to severe intracranial injuries, including subdural hematomas, which are blood clots that form between the brain and the dura mater (the outermost layer of the meninges).

Let's evaluate each option:
- A. Long bone fracture: While fractures can occur due to violent shaking, they are less common compared to brain injuries and are typically associated with other types of trauma.
- B. Ruptured spleen: This is more common with blunt abdominal trauma and not typically a result of violent shaking.
- C. Subdural haematoma: This is a significant intracranial injury that can result from violent shaking and is a common finding in cases of shaken baby syndrome.
- D. Skull bone fracture: While skull fractures can occur, they are less characteristic of shaken baby syndrome compared to subdural hematomas, which are more indicative of the mechanical forces involved in shaking.

Given these considerations, the most likely injury is a subdural hematoma.

- **Chondroblasts**: These cells are responsible for the formation of cartilage. They synthesize and secrete collagen and proteoglycans to form the matrix of cartilage.
- **Odontoblasts**: These cells are involved in the formation and maintenance of dentin, a calcified tissue in teeth. They do not primarily synthesize collagen.
- **Osteoblasts**: These cells are responsible for bone formation. They synthesize and secrete collagen to form the matrix of bone, which is then mineralized.
- **Fibroblasts**: These cells are found in connective tissues and are responsible for producing collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins.

Based on the functions of these cells, collagen biosynthesis is most closely associated with cells that form and maintain connective tissues, which includes chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts. However, the primary role of collagen biosynthesis is most directly linked to the formation of cartilage and bone, which are the functions of chondroblasts and osteoblasts.

968,"An obese 50-year-old woman undergoes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the recovery room she is found to be hypotensive and tachycardic. Her arterial blood gases reveal a pH of 7.29, partial pressure of oxygen of 60 kPa, and partial pressure of CO2 of 54 kPa. The most likely cause of this woman's problem is","['Acute pulmonary embolism', 'CO2 absorption from induced pneumoperitoneum', 'Alveolar hypoventilation', 'Pulmonary edema']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. **Patient Description and Initial Findings**: The patient is obese and has undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Postoperatively, she is hypotensive and tachycardic, which are signs of potential hemodynamic instability. The ABG results show a pH of 7.29 (which is slightly acidic, indicating metabolic acidosis), a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 60 kPa (normal range is 95-105 kPa), and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 54 kPa (normal range is 40-45 kPa).

2. **Analyzing the ABG Results**: The significant deviation from normal in PaCO2 (high) and pH (low) suggests a primary metabolic process, specifically metabolic acidosis with a compensatory respiratory response to maintain some level of respiratory alkalosis (since the PaCO2 is high, it indicates retention of CO2, which the body tries to correct by reducing respiratory rate and increasing PaO2, but the PaO2 is still low, indicating a respiratory problem).

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A. Acute pulmonary embolism**: This typically causes sudden hypotension and tachycardia, but usually with a lower PaO2 (hypoxemia) and less of a change in PaCO2.
   - **B. CO2 absorption from induced pneumoperitoneum**: While pneumoperitoneum can cause CO2 retention, it does not typically present with such a marked change in PaO2 and pH.
   - **C. Alveolar hypoventilation**: This directly affects respiratory gas exchange and can lead to a primary increase in PaCO2 and a decrease in PaO2, matching the ABG results seen here.
   - **D. Pulmonary edema**: This would typically cause hypoxemia and possibly hypotension but would not explain the high PaCO2.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the ABG results showing metabolic acidosis with a high PaCO2 and the patient's postoperative state, the most likely cause is alveolar hypoventilation, which is a common complication post-operatively, especially in obese patients.

A. Less no. of samples are associated with less error - This is generally true for statistical tests, as larger sample sizes tend to yield more reliable results due to reduced sampling error. However, the chi-square test specifically requires a minimum number of expected counts per cell, and smaller samples can lead to issues with the chi-square approximation. This statement is not entirely accurate for the chi-square test.

B. <0.001 is statistically significant - This is a general statement about statistical significance, but the threshold for significance can vary depending on the field and the specific study design. While <0.001 is often considered highly significant, it is not a universally true statement for all chi-square tests.

C. Categories of data used in test need not be mutually exclusive and discrete - This is incorrect. The chi-square test requires that the categories of data be mutually exclusive and discrete, meaning that each observation can only be classified into one category, and these categories do not overlap.

D. Tests correlation and regression - The chi-square test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables, not to test correlation or regression, which are typically analyzed using different statistical methods.

After reasoning through each option, the most accurate statement about the chi-square test is:

A. Supracondylar fracture of the humerus: This type of fracture typically occurs in children and can cause damage to the ulnar nerve due to its proximity to the fracture site. However, it is more commonly associated with immediate injury rather than a delayed effect.

B. Posterior dislocation of the elbow: This condition can also lead to ulnar nerve injury, but it is often due to the position and pressure on the nerve during the dislocation rather than a delayed effect.

C. Fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus in children: This type of fracture is common in children and can lead to ulnar nerve palsy. The ulnar nerve is closely related to the lateral condyle, and a fracture can result in compression or stretch of the nerve, leading to palsy. The palsy can sometimes be delayed as the inflammation and swelling resolve.

D. Fracture of the olecranon: While this can cause ulnar nerve injury, it is generally due to direct pressure or stretch on the nerve during the fracture, not a delayed effect.

Considering the context of the question, the most likely cause of tardy ulnar nerve palsy is a fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus in children, as it can lead to a delayed manifestation of the palsy due to the inflammatory process and subsequent resolution of swelling.

The sixth cranial nerve, also known as the abducens nerve, is responsible for the lateral (outward) movement of the eye. When there is a palsy of the sixth cranial nerve, the eye is unable to move outward, resulting in adduction weakness of the affected eye. This means the eye has difficulty moving towards the nose, and when looking to the side, the affected eye cannot move outward properly.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A. Accommodation paresis in left gaze - This refers to a weakening of the eye's ability to focus on close objects, not related to lateral movement issues.

B. Ptosis of left eye - This is a drooping of the eyelid, which is not a direct result of sixth cranial nerve palsy.

C. Adduction weakness of left eye - This indicates that the eye has difficulty moving towards the nose, which is consistent with sixth cranial nerve palsy.

D. Diplopia in left gaze - While this might be a consequence of the condition, it is not the primary cause of the palsy itself.

Given this reasoning, the correct answer is:

989,A volunteer Ram will receive a new drug in a phase I clinical trial. The clearance and the volume of distribution of the drug in Ram are 1.386 I/hr and 80 L respectively. The half life of the drug in him would be approximately:,"['83 hr', '77 hr', '40 hr', '0.02 hr']","To determine the half-life of the drug in Ram, we can use the relationship between clearance (Cl), volume of distribution (Vd), and the half-life (t1/2). The formula to calculate the half-life is:

\[ t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2) \times V_d}{Cl} \]

Where:
- \( \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \)
- \( V_d = 80 \, \text{L} \)
- \( Cl = 1.386 \, \text{I/hr} \)

Plugging in the values:

\[ t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693 \times 80}{1.386} \]

\[ t_{1/2} = \frac{55.44}{1.386} \]

\[ t_{1/2} \approx 40 \, \text{hr} \]

1. **Optic Chiasm Overview**: The optic chiasm is where the optic nerves from the two eyes partially cross. The nasal (inner) half of each optic nerve crosses to the opposite side, while the temporal (outer) half remains uncrossed.

2. **Lesions at the Optic Chiasm**: A lesion at the optic chiasm would affect the fibers that have crossed and uncrossed. 
   - Uncrossed fibers (temporal half) from both eyes would be affected if the lesion is large, leading to a loss of vision in the temporal hemifield (outer part of the visual field) of both eyes.
   - Crossed fibers (nasal half) from each eye would be spared, meaning the nasal hemifield (inner part of the visual field) of both eyes would remain unaffected.

3. **Bitemporal Hemianopia**: This is the loss of the temporal (outer) visual field of both eyes, which is exactly what would be seen in a lesion at the optic chiasm due to the crossing and uncrossed nature of the optic nerve fibers.

997,Folic acid metabolism is inhibited by :  a) Sulfonamides b) Methotrexate c) Nitrous oxide d) Trimethoprim e) 5–Flucytosine,"['acd', 'abd', 'bde', 'ace']","To determine which options inhibit folic acid metabolism, let's analyze each option:

a) Sulfonamides: These antibiotics work by inhibiting bacterial dihydropteroate synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria. Inhibiting this enzyme reduces the availability of folic acid, leading to bacterial cell death. 

b) Methotrexate: This is an antitumor drug that also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that is crucial for the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, a necessary step in the folic acid pathway. This inhibition leads to a block in nucleotide synthesis and ultimately to cell death.

c) Nitrous oxide: While nitrous oxide is commonly used as an anesthetic, it does not directly inhibit folic acid metabolism. It works by binding to the heme group of hemoglobin, leading to a decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity, but not by interfering with the folic acid pathway.

d) Trimethoprim: This antibiotic works by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which is similar to methotrexate. This inhibition blocks the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth.

e) 5-Flucytosine: This antifungal medication is metabolized in the body to fluorouracil, which then inhibits thymidylate synthase, not directly interfering with the folic acid pathway.

Based on the analysis, the options that inhibit folic acid metabolism are a) Sulfonamides, b) Methotrexate, and d) Trimethoprim.

1. **Primary Teeth (Deciduous Teeth):**
   - Root formation in primary teeth begins shortly after the tooth germ (the initial stage of tooth development) is established.
   - The root formation process is relatively quick, typically taking about a year for the tooth to fully develop its root.

2. **Permanent Teeth:**
   - Root formation in permanent teeth starts later than in primary teeth, usually around the time the primary tooth is erupting.
   - The process of root formation in permanent teeth takes longer, often extending for several years after the tooth erupts, sometimes up to 10 years or more, depending on the tooth.

Comparing the two:
- Root formation in primary teeth is completed in about a year.
- Root formation in permanent teeth can take much longer, sometimes up to a decade.

A. It affects only the deep venous system: Venous thrombosis can occur in both the deep veins (DVT) and superficial veins. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

B. Most important factor for development of deep venous thrombosis is hospital admission: While hospital admission can be a risk factor, it is not the most important factor. Risk factors for DVT include immobility, cancer, surgery, genetic predispositions, and hormonal changes. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

C. Coralline thrombus is platelet aggregate surrounded by white blood cells: Coralline thrombi are actually characterized by a dense, calcium-rich matrix within the thrombus, not being primarily platelet and white blood cell aggregates. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

D. Lung infarction is a common complication of deep venous thrombosis: This is correct. A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a complication of a DVT where a clot from a deep vein breaks off and travels to the lungs, leading to a blockage in the pulmonary arteries and potentially causing a pulmonary infarction.

1023,Negative nitrogen balance is the characteristic feature of which phase of convalescence after surgery?,"['Catabolic phase', 'Anabolic phase', 'Fat gain phase', 'Tuning point phase']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what negative nitrogen balance is and the phases of convalescence after surgery.

1. **Negative Nitrogen Balance**: This occurs when the body is using more protein than it is taking in. In other words, there is a deficit in protein synthesis. This can happen during times of stress or illness when the body is breaking down protein for energy.

2. **Phases of Convalescence After Surgery**:
   - **Catabolic Phase**: This is the initial phase where the body is in a state of breakdown. It is characterized by increased metabolic rate, loss of muscle mass, and negative nitrogen balance due to the stress of surgery.
   - **Anabolic Phase**: This is the phase where the body starts to repair and rebuild tissues. It is characterized by positive nitrogen balance as the body begins to synthesize proteins.
   - **Fat Gain Phase**: This phase is not a standard medical term in the context of convalescence after surgery.
   - **Tuning Point Phase**: This is not a recognized medical phase in the context of convalescence after surgery.

Given these definitions, the Catabolic Phase is the initial phase after surgery where the body is breaking down proteins to use as energy, leading to a negative nitrogen balance.

1024,A 27 year old sexually active male develops a vesiculobullous lesion on the glans soon after within 8hrs taking tablet diclofenac for viral fever. The lesion healed with hyperpigmentation.The most likely dignosis is-,"[""Behcet's syndrome"", 'herpes genitalis', 'fixed drug erruption', 'pemphigus vulgaris']","To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the clinical scenario:

1. **Age and Sex**: The patient is a 27-year-old male, which is within the typical age range for these conditions.
2. **Symptoms**: A vesiculobullous lesion developed on the glans penis soon after taking diclofenac, and it healed with hyperpigmentation.
3. **Drug Reaction**:
   - **Behcet's syndrome**: This condition typically presents with recurrent oral and genital ulcers, along with other systemic symptoms like skin lesions and uveitis. However, it does not usually involve a vesiculobullous reaction.
   - **Herpes genitalis**: This condition is caused by the herpes simplex virus and typically presents with painful, clustered vesicles on the genital area. The healing process can involve crusting and scarring, but it is less likely to present with hyperpigmentation.
   - **Fixed drug eruption**: This is a type of adverse drug reaction that presents with a localized, well-demarcated, and recurrent skin lesion at the same site each time the drug is taken. The lesions are usually painful, vesiculobullous, and can resolve with hyperpigmentation.
   - **Pemphigus vulgaris**: This is an autoimmune blistering disease that typically presents with flaccid blisters that occur on the skin and mucous membranes. It is not associated with a vesiculobullous reaction or hyperpigmentation following a drug intake.

Given the vesiculobullous lesion, the localized nature of the reaction, the healing with hyperpigmentation, and the fact that it occurred after taking a specific medication, the most likely diagnosis is a fixed drug eruption.

1026,All are true regarding fetal BBC's except –,"['Elevated 2,3 DPG', 'Decreased carbonic anhydrase activity', 'Decreased life span', 'High RBC volume']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and fetal blood cells (BBC):

A. Elevated 2,3 DPG: Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin (HbA). This results in a lower 2,3 DPG level in fetal blood, as the higher oxygen affinity of HbF shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, which is more efficient for oxygen delivery to the rapidly growing fetal tissues.

B. Decreased carbonic anhydrase activity: Carbonic anhydrase plays a critical role in the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. In fetal blood, there is an increased activity of carbonic anhydrase to facilitate the efficient exchange of gases in the lungs and to maintain the acid-base balance. Therefore, this statement is not true for fetal blood.

C. Decreased life span: Fetal red blood cells (RBCs) have a shorter lifespan compared to adult RBCs. This is due to the rapid development and turnover of fetal tissues and the increased oxygen demand.

D. High RBC volume: Fetal RBC volume is indeed higher than that of the adult due to the increased demand for oxygen and the rapid growth of the fetus.

Given the analysis, the statement that is not true regarding fetal BBCs is B. Decreased carbonic anhydrase activity.

1027,Initial ECG change in Hyperkalemia is?,"['Tall tented T waves', 'PR prolongation', 'qRS widening', 'ST segment depression']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. **Understanding Hyperkalemia**: Hyperkalemia is an abnormally high level of potassium in the blood. This can affect the electrical activity of the heart.

2. **ECG Changes in Hyperkalemia**: ECG changes in hyperkalemia typically occur in a specific sequence:
   - **Initial Change**: Tall, peaked T waves
   - **Subsequent Changes**: PR interval shortening, QRS widening, and ST segment depression.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A. Tall tented T waves**: This is indeed the initial change seen in ECG during hyperkalemia.
   - **B. PR prolongation**: This is not a common initial change; it occurs later.
   - **C. qRS widening**: This is a late change and not the initial finding.
   - **D. ST segment depression**: This is also a late change and not the initial finding.

Given this reasoning, the initial ECG change in hyperkalemia is tall, peaked T waves.

1028,NREM sleep is associated with:-,"['Basal forebrain area', 'Dorsal raphe nucleus', 'Medulla', 'All of the above']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down each option and its association with NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep.

1. **Basal forebrain area**: This region is primarily involved in promoting and maintaining wakefulness, but it does play a role in regulating sleep, including NREM sleep. However, its primary role is not as strongly linked to NREM sleep as some other brain areas.

2. **Dorsal raphe nucleus**: This nucleus is known for its role in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles and is particularly active during NREM sleep. It is involved in the production of serotonin, which is a neurotransmitter that influences sleep.

3. **Medulla**: The medulla oblongata is a part of the brainstem that plays a crucial role in several important physiological functions, including respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure. It is also involved in the regulation of sleep, particularly NREM sleep, through its role in the sleep cycle and arousal.

Given these points, the dorsal raphe nucleus and the medulla are more directly associated with NREM sleep than the basal forebrain area. However, the basal forebrain area does play a role in sleep regulation, which indirectly supports NREM sleep.

Considering the options provided, the most accurate answer would be that all of these regions (basal forebrain area, dorsal raphe nucleus, and medulla) are involved in NREM sleep, even if their roles are not the most direct.

1030,"A young male presents with ear discharge since three years; recently developed swelling in the neck below and behind the angle of mandible, toicollis; on the examination, the external auditory canal was filled with granulation tissue. What is the diagnosis?","[""Luc's abscess"", ""Citelli's abscess"", ""Bezold's abscess"", 'Parapharyngeal abscess']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. **Ear Discharge**: The patient has had ear discharge for three years, which suggests a chronic condition.
2. **Neck Swelling**: The swelling in the neck below and behind the angle of the mandible is a key finding. This is a critical piece of information.
3. **Toicollis**: This describes a condition where the neck is tilted to one side, which can be a sign of infection or inflammation in the neck region.
4. **External Auditory Canal**: The external auditory canal is filled with granulation tissue, indicating chronic inflammation or infection.

Considering these symptoms:
- **Luc's abscess** is an abscess of the external auditory canal, but it doesn’t typically present with neck swelling or toicollis.
- **Citelli's abscess** is a rare condition, and it's not commonly associated with the described symptoms.
- **Bezold's abscess** is an infection of the peritonsillar space, which can cause swelling in the neck and toicollis. However, it is less likely to be associated with granulation tissue in the external auditory canal.
- **Parapharyngeal abscess** is a more severe condition that can cause neck swelling and toicollis. It involves the space behind the tonsil, which can lead to symptoms like those described. The presence of chronic ear discharge and external auditory canal changes fits well with this diagnosis.

1. **Patient Presentation**: A 27-year-old white man with fatigue, slight fever, and a macular rash over his trunk and on the palms of his hands. These symptoms are suggestive of a systemic rash and fever, which could be indicative of various infectious diseases.

2. **Recent Trip to Las Vegas**: This detail is important because it suggests the man might have been exposed to different pathogens common in that area.

3. **Macular Rash**: The presence of a macular rash, which is flat and can appear on the palms, is a notable feature. This type of rash can be associated with various conditions, but in the context of travel and other symptoms, it narrows down the possibilities.

4. **No Lesions or Ulcers on the Penis**: This detail rules out sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis (caused by Treponema pallidum) or gonorrhea (caused by Neisseria gonorrhea), which often present with genital lesions or ulcers.

5. **Exclusion of Chlamydia trachomatis**: While Chlamydia trachomatis can cause a variety of symptoms, including genital symptoms, it is less likely given the lack of specific symptoms like discharge or painful urination.

6. **Borrelia burgdorferi**: Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, which often presents with a characteristic rash called erythema migrans, though it can also present with a macular rash and systemic symptoms like fatigue and fever. Lyme disease is often associated with tick bites and can be acquired in areas with high tick populations, which might include Las Vegas or nearby regions.

1036,Pro - inflammatory cytokine is?,"['IL-1', 'IL-3', 'IL-6', 'IL-10']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what pro-inflammatory cytokines are. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are small proteins that play a critical role in the inflammatory response, helping to recruit immune cells to sites of injury or infection. They are involved in the acute phase of inflammation and can cause symptoms such as redness, swelling, heat, and pain.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. IL-1 (Interleukin-1): IL-1 is indeed a pro-inflammatory cytokine. It is involved in the acute inflammatory response and can cause fever, pain, and other symptoms of inflammation.

B. IL-3: Interleukin-3 is primarily involved in hematopoiesis (blood cell formation) and is not typically classified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine.

C. IL-6: Interleukin-6 can have both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects depending on the context, but it is often considered a pro-inflammatory cytokine due to its role in the acute phase response.

D. IL-10: Interleukin-10 is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, and it helps to resolve inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Given this information, the correct answer is the cytokine that is primarily pro-inflammatory.

A. Sheehan's syndrome: This is a condition where the pituitary gland is damaged, leading to a deficiency in hormones including estrogen and progesterone, which can result in amenorrhea. However, it is more commonly associated with secondary amenorrhea due to its onset after normal menstrual function has begun and is disrupted later.

B. Kallmann's syndrome: This is a condition characterized by the absence of the sense of smell (anosmia) and delayed or absent puberty, often leading to primary amenorrhea due to the lack of sufficient gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.

C. Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome: This syndrome is characterized by the congenital absence of the uterus and often the upper part of the vagina. This results in primary amenorrhea as the reproductive system does not develop normally.

D. Turner syndrome: This is a condition where a female has only one X chromosome (45,X), leading to a lack of normal female reproductive development and often resulting in primary amenorrhea.

1041,"A 6-year-old child has an accident and had elbow, after 4 years presented with tingling and numbness in the ulnar side of finger, fracture is","['supra condylar humerus', 'lateral condylar humerus', 'olecranon', 'dislocation of elbow']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the clinical presentation and the given options:

1. **Supracondylar Humerus Fracture (Option A)**: This type of fracture occurs above the elbow, typically in children. It commonly causes swelling, pain, and difficulty in moving the arm. Tingling and numbness in the ulnar side of the fingers are less common but can occur if the ulnar nerve is affected by the fracture or if there is compression on the nerve due to the swelling.

2. **Lateral Condylar Humerus Fracture (Option B)**: This type of fracture occurs at the outer part of the elbow. It is more common in younger children and typically does not directly affect the ulnar nerve or cause tingling and numbness in the ulnar side of the fingers.

3. **Olecranon Fracture (Option C)**: This type of fracture involves the bony prominence on the back of the elbow. It usually does not affect the ulnar nerve and is not associated with tingling and numbness in the ulnar side of the fingers.

4. **Dislocation of Elbow (Option D)**: This involves the dislocation of the bones of the elbow joint. While it can cause significant pain and swelling, it is less likely to cause prolonged tingling and numbness in the ulnar side of the fingers unless there is nerve involvement during the dislocation, which is uncommon.

Given that the child has had a tingling and numbness in the ulnar side of the fingers four years after the accident, the most likely scenario is that the supracondylar humerus fracture (Option A) has caused compression on the ulnar nerve, leading to chronic symptoms. The lateral condylar humerus fracture (Option B), olecranon fracture (Option C), and dislocation of the elbow (Option D) are less likely to cause such long-term nerve symptoms.

1043,"A 10-year-old boy presents with increase bilirubin, increased bilirubin in urine and no urobilinogen Diagnosis is:","['Gilbert syndrome', 'Hemolytic jaundice', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Obstructive jaundice']","Let's analyze the symptoms and the options provided:

1. **Increase in Bilirubin**: This indicates jaundice, a condition where there is an excess of bilirubin in the blood.
2. **Increased Bilirubin in Urine**: This is consistent with jaundice.
3. **No Urobilinogen**: Urobilinogen is a product of bilirubin metabolism. Its absence in the urine can help differentiate between types of jaundice.

Now, let's consider the options:

- **A. Gilbert syndrome**: This is a benign condition characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It often does not cause an increase in bilirubin in urine, and there is usually no significant elevation of conjugated bilirubin. Therefore, it is unlikely to explain the absence of urobilinogen in the urine.

- **B. Hemolytic jaundice**: This condition is characterized by an increase in unconjugated bilirubin due to increased red blood cell breakdown. Typically, there would be urobilinogen in the urine because bilirubin is converted to urobilinogen before it is excreted in the urine. The absence of urobilinogen suggests that the bilirubin is not being metabolized to this stage.

- **C. Viral hepatitis**: This can cause jaundice with elevated bilirubin, but it usually leads to conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and there might be urobilinogen in the urine due to the liver's impaired function. 

- **D. Obstructive jaundice**: This condition results in elevated conjugated bilirubin due to obstruction of the bile duct. There might be no urobilinogen in the urine if the obstruction is complete, as the bilirubin cannot be excreted into the bile and then into the urine.

Given the presence of increased bilirubin in the blood and urine but no urobilinogen, the most likely diagnosis is that the bilirubin is not being properly metabolized or excreted into the bile, which is characteristic of hemolytic jaundice.

1049,Rigor mois not seen in: AIIMS 13,"['Fetus < 7 months of age', 'Full term fetus', 'Elderly', 'Anemic person']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what rigor mortis is. Rigor mortis is the state of muscular rigidity that occurs after death. This rigidity is caused by the loss of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in the muscles, which leads to the inability of the muscles to relax.

Rigor mortis is typically seen in a full-term fetus shortly after birth, and it can also be observed in elderly individuals who have recently died. However, the fetus before 7 months of age and anemic individuals do not typically exhibit rigor mortis.

- **Option A (Fetus < 7 months of age):** The fetus before 7 months of age is still in a developing stage and has not yet experienced the physiological changes that lead to rigor mortis.
- **Option B (Full term fetus):** Rigor mortis can be seen in a full-term fetus shortly after birth.
- **Option C (Elderly):** Elderly individuals can exhibit rigor mortis if they have recently died.

1. **Depressor Reflex**: This reflex is triggered by a fall in blood pressure or a drop in the oxygen content of the blood. It results in bradycardia (slower heart rate) and vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) to increase blood flow and maintain blood pressure.

2. **Bezold-Jarisch Reflex**: This reflex is a response to a rapid decrease in blood volume or pressure, and it includes bradycardia and vasodilation, similar to the depressor reflex. It is particularly associated with the stimulation of the aortic and carotid sinus baroreceptors.

- **A. Atrial overload**: This condition is more related to the filling pressures in the heart and might not directly stimulate the depressor or Bezold-Jarisch reflex as described.
- **B. Myocardial infarction**: This is a condition that can lead to a decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure but is not specifically known to trigger a depressor reflex or Bezold-Jarisch reflex.
- **C. Ventricular distension**: This can be associated with an increase in pressure within the ventricles, which can stimulate baroreceptors and potentially trigger a depressor reflex or Bezold-Jarisch reflex.
- **D. Isotonic exercise**: This typically increases blood pressure and cardiac output, which is the opposite of what the depressor reflex aims to achieve.

Considering the options, ventricular distension (option C) is the most likely stimulus for both the depressor reflex and Bezold-Jarisch reflex, as it can lead to changes in blood pressure and volume that can activate the baroreceptors responsible for these reflexes.

1071,A patient of RHD developed infective endocarditis after dental extraction. Most likely organism causing this is -,"['Streptococcus viridans', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Staphylococcus aureus']","Let's reason through this step by step:

1. **Understanding RHD and its Implications**:
   - RHD stands for Rheumatic Heart Disease, which is a complication of rheumatic fever.
   - Patients with RHD often have damaged heart valves, which can be more susceptible to infections.

2. **Infective Endocarditis**:
   - This is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, particularly the heart valves.
   - It can occur in patients with damaged valves due to various factors, including dental procedures.

3. **Common Causes**:
   - The most common organisms that cause infective endocarditis in patients with damaged heart valves include Streptococcus viridans (group D), Staphylococcus aureus, and other gram-negative bacteria.

4. **Dental Procedural Risk**:
   - Dental procedures can cause bacteria in the mouth to enter the bloodstream, increasing the risk of infective endocarditis.
   - Streptococcus viridans, which are part of the normal oral flora, are particularly common in this context.

5. **Elimination of Other Options**:
   - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are more commonly associated with respiratory infections and skin infections, respectively, rather than infective endocarditis after dental procedures.
   - Staphylococcus aureus can cause endocarditis but is less common than Streptococcus viridans in this context.

Given the above reasoning, the most likely organism causing the infective endocarditis in a patient with RHD after a dental extraction is Streptococcus viridans.

A. **ESWL (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy)**: This procedure uses shock waves to break up kidney stones. It is often used for stones in the upper ureter or kidney, but less effective for lower ureteral stones due to the difficulty in focusing the shock waves accurately.

B. **PCNL (Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy)**: This is a more invasive procedure used for large kidney stones or those causing significant obstruction. It is not typically the first-line treatment for lower ureteral stones.

C. **Open Ureterolithotomy**: This is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision to access the ureter and remove the stone. It is highly invasive and reserved for complex cases, especially when other options have failed.

D. **Ureteroscopic Retrieval**: This procedure involves passing a small telescope through the urethra and bladder to the ureter to locate and remove the stone. It is effective for lower ureteral stones and can be used for stones associated with proximal hydroureteronephrosis, as it allows direct visualization and removal of the stone, addressing both the stone and the obstruction.

A. RBC cholinesterase level: Red blood cell cholinesterase is a specific marker that decreases in response to organophosphorus exposure. This is because cholinesterase is inhibited by organophosphorus compounds, leading to a measurable decrease in activity.

B. Plasma cholinestrase level: While plasma cholinesterase can also be affected, it is not as specific for organophosphorus poisoning as RBC cholinesterase because it is influenced by many other factors.

C. RBC uroporphyrin level: Uroporphyrin levels are typically associated with hemolytic disorders and porphyrias, not specifically with organophosphorus poisoning.

D. Measurement of serum level of organophosphorous: Measuring the actual organophosphorous compound in the serum is not practical and not routinely available. The levels of the compound itself can fluctuate rapidly and are not as reliable as cholinesterase levels for diagnosis.

The most specific and reliable test for organophosphorous poisoning is the RBC cholinesterase level.

1. **Cell count in CSF**: 10 RBCs/HPF, 50 cells - This indicates a relatively low cell count, which is not typical for meningitis, where a much higher cell count (often hundreds or thousands of cells/HPF) is usually seen, especially if it is bacterial meningitis.

2. **Protein in CSF**: 70 mg/dL - This is within normal limits (usually <45 mg/dL for a neonate) and does not point towards meningitis, which typically shows elevated protein levels.

3. **Sugar in CSF**: 30 mg/dL - This is significantly lower than blood sugar (40 mg/dL), which is indicative of glucose crossing the blood-brain barrier, often seen in bacterial meningitis or other conditions affecting the blood-brain barrier. However, in this case, the low CSF glucose without a high cell count and protein is less indicative of meningitis.

4. **Blood sugar**: 40 mg/dL - This is within the normal range for blood glucose.

Given the low cell count and normal protein and glucose levels in CSF, the most likely diagnosis is not meningitis.

1083,Most common cause of UTI in a neonate is,"['E.coli', 'S. aureus', 'Enterococcus', 'Anerobes']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. Understanding UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): UTIs in neonates are infections of the urinary tract, which can range from the bladder (cystitis) to the kidneys (pyelonephritis).

2. Common Pathogens: The most common bacteria causing UTIs in neonates are those that can ascend from the lower urinary tract to the kidneys. In neonates, the urinary tract is more susceptible to infection due to their immature immune system.

3. Evaluating Options:
   - A. E. coli: This is the most common cause of UTIs in neonates and older children and adults. It's a gram-negative bacillus that is easily passed from the rectum to the urinary tract.
   - B. S. aureus: Staphylococcus aureus is more commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections, though it can cause UTIs, it is not the most common.
   - C. Enterococcus: While it can cause UTIs, it is less common in neonates compared to E. coli.
   - D. Anaerobes: These are bacteria that do not require oxygen to grow. While they can cause infections, they are not the primary cause of UTIs in neonates.

4. Conclusion: Based on the prevalence and ease of transmission, E. coli is the most common cause of UTIs in neonates.

1084,Insulin stimulated glucose entry in seen in-,"['Cardiac muscles', 'Smooth muscles', 'Brain', 'Intestines']","To determine where insulin stimulates glucose entry, we need to consider the physiological role of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that primarily functions to regulate blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. It does this by binding to insulin receptors on the cell surface, leading to the translocation of glucose transporters to the cell membrane, thereby increasing glucose uptake.

- **Cardiac muscles**: While cardiac muscle cells do utilize glucose for energy, insulin does not play a primary role in glucose entry into these cells compared to other tissues.
- **Smooth muscles**: Smooth muscles do not rely on insulin for glucose uptake as they can use fatty acids and other substrates for energy.
- **Brain**: The brain is an exception where glucose is a primary energy source, but insulin does not directly stimulate glucose entry into brain cells. Brain cells have a high basal uptake of glucose that is not insulin-dependent.
- **Intestines**: The intestines have a significant role in absorbing glucose, and insulin plays a crucial role in enhancing glucose uptake from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream and then into other tissues.

Given these points, the most accurate answer is the intestines, as they are a primary site for insulin-stimulated glucose entry.

1. **Understanding Epinephrine and Lignocaine:**
   - **Epinephrine (Adrenaline):** Acts as a vasoconstrictor, reducing bleeding and prolonging the duration of the local anesthetic effect.
   - **Lignocaine (Lidocaine):** A commonly used local anesthetic that provides analgesia by blocking sodium channels in nerve cells.

2. **Effects of Adding Epinephrine to Lignocaine:**
   - **Duration of Action:** Adding epinephrine to lignocaine increases the duration of the local anesthetic effect by reducing the absorption of the anesthetic into the bloodstream, thus prolonging its effectiveness.
   - **Risk of Convulsions:** While epinephrine does have a vasoconstrictive effect, it also has the potential to cause systemic side effects if administered in high doses, including tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases, convulsions. However, when used in appropriate concentrations for local administration, the risk of systemic toxicity and convulsions is generally low.

3. **Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Increasing the risk of convulsions is not a primary effect of adding epinephrine to lignocaine in the context of a peripheral nerve block.
   - **Option B:** This option correctly states that adding epinephrine increases the duration of action of the local anesthetic.

Local excision is generally considered for small, early-stage tumors that do not involve critical structures or have specific anatomical limitations.

- **Option A: Within 10 cm of the dentate line** - This is a critical anatomical limitation because the dentate line is the boundary between the anal canal and the rectum. Excision closer to this line can be risky due to the proximity to the sphincter muscles and other critical structures.
- **Option B: Lesion 2.7 cm** - The size of the tumor (2.7 cm) is not an absolute contraindication for local excision. Local excision is often considered for smaller tumors.
- **Option C: Involvement of <30% bowel circumference** - This indicates that the tumor does not extensively involve the bowel wall, which is a favorable condition for local excision.
- **Option D: T1 and T2 cancer with lymph node involvement** - Local excision is generally not recommended if there is lymph node involvement, as this suggests a more advanced stage of the disease.

Considering the above points, the primary anatomical limitation for local excision is the proximity to the dentate line, which is explicitly mentioned in Option A.

- **B. Pemphigus foliaceous**: This type of pemphigus usually presents with skin lesions but rarely involves mucous membranes.
- **C. Dermatitis herpetiformis**: This condition is typically characterized by intensely itchy, blistering skin lesions and is not usually associated with mucosal involvement.
- **D. Pemphigoid**: This condition often causes blisters on the skin but typically does not affect the mucous membranes as severely as pemphigus.

Given the presence of both a palatal ulcer (mucosal involvement) and skin blisters, the most likely diagnosis is Pemphigus vulgaris, as it commonly affects both mucous membranes and the skin.

1100,Concerning contraction of the diaphragm:,"['The nerves that are responsible emerge from the spinal cord at the level of the lower thorax', 'It tends to flatten the diaphragm', 'It reduces the lateral distance between the lower rib margins', 'It causes the anterior abdominal wall to move in']","Let's analyze each option to determine the correct answer:

A. The nerves that are responsible emerge from the spinal cord at the level of the lower thorax.
- The diaphragm is primarily innervated by the phrenic nerve, which originates from the cervical spinal cord (C3, C4, and C5) and descends through the neck and thorax to innervate the diaphragm. This statement is not entirely accurate as it mentions the lower thorax, but the phrenic nerve actually originates from the cervical spinal cord.

B. It tends to flatten the diaphragm.
- When the diaphragm contracts, it moves downward, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity. This action is the opposite of flattening. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

C. It reduces the lateral distance between the lower rib margins.
- The contraction of the diaphragm does not affect the lateral distance between the lower rib margins. This statement is incorrect.

D. It causes the anterior abdominal wall to move in.
- When the diaphragm contracts, it moves downward, which increases the vertical distance and pulls the abdominal contents downward. This causes the anterior abdominal wall to move inward. This statement is correct.

1101,Congo red staining of abdominal fat has confirmed a diagnosis of Amyloidosis in a 28-year-old man. Which is the most common cause of death in primary AL Amylodosis?,"['Respiratory failure', 'Cardiac failure', 'Renal failure', 'Septicemia']","To determine the most common cause of death in primary AL Amyloidosis, we need to consider the organ systems commonly affected by amyloid deposition. Primary AL Amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis caused by the abnormal production and deposition of light chains from plasma cells. This condition often leads to involvement of multiple organ systems, but certain organs are more frequently affected.

1. **Respiratory failure**: While respiratory complications can occur, they are not the most common cause of death.
2. **Cardiac failure**: Amyloid deposition in the heart can lead to cardiomyopathy, which is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in AL Amyloidosis.
3. **Renal failure**: Kidney involvement is also common, but renal failure is not as frequently the primary cause of death compared to cardiac failure.
4. **Septicemia**: Septicemia can occur but is not the most common cause of death in AL Amyloidosis.

Given the systemic nature of AL Amyloidosis and the frequent involvement of the heart, cardiac failure is the most common cause of death in this condition.

1103,Infants of diabetic mothers are likely to have the following cardiac anomaly:,"['Coarctation of aorta', ""Fallot's tetralogy"", ""Ebstein's anomaly"", 'Transposition of great arteries']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the cardiac anomalies listed and their associations with infants of diabetic mothers.

A. Coarctation of the aorta: This is a narrowing of the aorta, usually just after it branches off from the heart. It is not specifically associated with infants of diabetic mothers.

B. Fallot's tetralogy: This is a combination of four heart defects, including a ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. It is not specifically linked to infants of diabetic mothers.

C. Ebstein's anomaly: This involves the abnormal placement of the tricuspid valve and can be associated with congenital heart defects in offspring of diabetic mothers, especially if the mother had poorly controlled diabetes.

D. Transposition of the great arteries: This is a serious congenital heart defect where the positions of the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched, leading to oxygen-poor blood circulating to the body. It is not specifically linked to infants of diabetic mothers.

Given that Ebstein's anomaly is more commonly associated with infants of diabetic mothers, especially if the mother had poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy, the correct answer is C.

Management should include all of the following EXCEPT?","['Barium enema', 'IV fluid', 'Give O2', 'Nasogastric tube']","Let's analyze the scenario and the options provided:

- A 9-month-old girl with PR bleed (presumably, a pruritic rash or petechiae, but the term is ambiguous in this context, possibly a typo or miscommunication) and vomiting suggests a possible abdominal or systemic infection, hematologic disorder, or other serious conditions.
- A mass in the right lumbar region with masked liver dullness could indicate a variety of conditions, including a retroperitoneal mass or a problem with the kidney or adrenal gland.
- The child is in a shock-like condition, which suggests severe dehydration, sepsis, or another critical condition.

Given these symptoms, the immediate management should include:
- IV fluid (B) to address shock and dehydration.
- Oxygen (C) to ensure adequate oxygenation.
- Nasogastric tube (D) to manage vomiting and maintain fluid/electrolyte balance.

Barium enema (A) is generally not indicated for a patient in shock and with a mass in the lumbar region. This procedure is typically used for investigating bowel obstruction, constipation, or malrotation, which does not seem to align with the described symptoms.

1107,Forceps delivery is done in all except:,"['Mentoposterior', 'Deep transverse arrest', 'After coming head', 'Maternal heart disease']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of forceps delivery:

A. Mentoposterior: This refers to a fetal position where the head is facing the mother's back. Forceps can be used in such positions to assist in delivery.

B. Deep transverse arrest: This is a situation where the fetal head is in a transverse (sideways) position, making forceps delivery more challenging and less commonly used.

C. After coming head: Once the fetal head is visible at the cervix (crowning), forceps can be used to assist in completing the delivery.

D. Maternal heart disease: While maternal heart disease is a significant health condition, it does not necessarily preclude the use of forceps. However, the decision to use forceps would need to be made with careful consideration of the patient's overall health.

Given this reasoning, the scenario where forceps delivery is least likely to be performed is when there is deep transverse arrest due to the complexity and risks associated with this fetal position.

1108,Which one of the following phenomena is closely associated with slow wave sleep:,"['Dreaming', 'Atonia', 'Sleep walking', 'Irregular hea rate']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down each option in relation to slow wave sleep (SWS), also known as deep sleep or non-REM sleep stages 3 and 4:

A. Dreaming: Dreams are more commonly associated with REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep rather than SWS. During SWS, dreams are less vivid and occur less frequently.

B. Atonia: Atonia, or the temporary paralysis of the muscles that occurs during REM sleep, is not a characteristic of SWS.

C. Sleep walking: Sleepwalking can occur during any stage of sleep, but it is more common in the first few hours of sleep, which includes SWS. However, it is not a defining feature specifically of SWS.

D. Irregular heart rate: During SWS, heart rate and breathing become slower and more regular, which is the opposite of an irregular heart rate.

The most closely associated phenomenon with slow wave sleep is a more regular and slower heart rate, which is not listed as an option. However, the closest option that aligns with the characteristics of SWS is atonia, which occurs during REM sleep but can be associated with the transition from SWS to REM sleep.

1109,Digestion of disaccharides occurs at ?,"['Mouth', 'Stomach', 'Small intestine', 'Large intestine']","To determine where the digestion of disaccharides occurs, we need to consider the functions of each part of the digestive system:

- The mouth contains enzymes like amylase that break down starches into simpler sugars, but it does not specifically break down disaccharides.
- The stomach primarily uses hydrochloric acid and enzymes to break down proteins and some fats, but it does not digest disaccharides effectively.
- The small intestine is where most of the nutrient absorption occurs. It contains enzymes like lactase, sucrase, and maltase that specifically break down lactose, sucrose, and maltose (disaccharides) into their monosaccharide components.
- The large intestine mainly absorbs water and some minerals and does not significantly break down disaccharides.

Based on this information, the correct location for the digestion of disaccharides is the small intestine.

1110,"In IMNCI, pneumonia is classified by-","['Fast breathing', 'Wheezing', 'Fever', 'Chest indrawing']","To determine the correct classification for pneumonia in the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) program, we need to consider the clinical signs and symptoms that are used to diagnose pneumonia in this framework. IMNCI focuses on identifying pneumonia based on certain key symptoms, with the primary indicators being fast breathing and chest indrawing.

- Fast breathing is a common and early sign of pneumonia in young children.
- Chest indrawing, or the inward movement of the chest wall during breathing, is another reliable indicator of severe pneumonia.

Fever and wheezing are also important clinical signs, but they are not the primary criteria for pneumonia classification in IMNCI.

Given the options provided, the primary classification for pneumonia in IMNCI is based on fast breathing and chest indrawing. However, since the question asks for the most directly listed option, and fast breathing is one of the primary indicators, the correct answer is:

Which of the following drugs is least likely to be involved in this side effect -","['Haloperidol', 'Clozapine', 'Fluphenazine', 'Loxapine']","The symptoms described, such as purposeless involuntary facial and limb movements, constant chewing, and puffing of cheeks, are indicative of tardive dyskinesia, a side effect commonly associated with antipsychotic medications. Haloperidol, Fluphenazine, and Loxapine are typical first-generation (or conventional) antipsychotics and are known to have a higher risk of causing tardive dyskinesia. Clozapine, on the other hand, is a second-generation antipsychotic and, while it can cause tardive dyskinesia, it is less likely to do so compared to first-generation antipsychotics.

Therefore, the drug least likely to be involved in this side effect is Clozapine.

1113,Which of the following tests is best for differentiating ACTH secreting pituitary tumour from Ectopic ACTH production?,"['24 hour Urinary free coisol', 'Overnight dexamethasone suppression test', 'Low dose dexamethasone suppression test', 'High dose dexamethasone suppression test']","To differentiate between an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor and ectopic ACTH production, the key is to determine the source of the ACTH. In ectopic ACTH production, the ACTH is produced by a tumor outside the pituitary gland, whereas in a pituitary tumor, ACTH is produced by the pituitary itself.

The high dose dexamethasone suppression test is the most effective in distinguishing these conditions because it differentiates between pituitary-dependent and non-pituitary (ectopic) ACTH production. High dose dexamethasone suppresses pituitary-dependent ACTH production but not ectopic ACTH production.

- In a pituitary tumor, high dose dexamethasone will suppress the ACTH levels, indicating pituitary dependence.
- In ectopic ACTH production, ACTH levels will remain elevated despite high dose dexamethasone, indicating non-pituitary source.

The other tests listed are not as specific for this differentiation:

- 24 hour Urinary free cortisol test measures cortisol levels but does not distinguish the source.
- Overnight and Low dose dexamethasone suppression tests are used to diagnose Cushing's disease but are not as specific for differentiating pituitary from ectopic ACTH production.

The diagnosis points towards","[""De Quervain's thyroiditis"", ""Riedel's thyroiditis"", 'Hashimoto’s thyroiditis', 'None of the above']","Let's analyze the information provided:

1. The patient is a 30-year-old female with a painless, hard, anterior neck mass.
2. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) was inconclusive.
3. An open thyroid biopsy was performed, showing a fibrous, woody, non-tender thyroid mass.

Riedel's thyroiditis is characterized by:
- Chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland
- Extensive fibrosis leading to a hard, non-tender mass
- Often mimics malignancy on imaging and biopsy

De Quervain's thyroiditis typically presents with:
- Diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland
- Pain and tenderness
- Usually occurs in women and is often associated with hyperthyroidism

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized by:
- Diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland
- Usually associated with hypothyroidism
- Inflammation and lymphocytic infiltrate on biopsy

- **A. Upper lobe infiltrates:** Pentamidine is often used to treat Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV/AIDS. PCP can cause infiltrates in the lungs, but these infiltrates are typically seen in the lower lobes rather than the upper lobes. However, the presence of infiltrates in the upper lobes is not specifically characteristic of pentamidine therapy itself but rather a manifestation of the infection being treated.

- **B. Cavitation:** Cavitation is not a typical finding associated with PCP or the use of pentamidine. Cavitation usually occurs in other conditions, such as tuberculosis or some fungal infections.

- **C. Extrathoracic manifestation:** Pentamidine therapy can lead to various extrathoracic manifestations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, renal dysfunction, and hematologic abnormalities, due to its systemic effects.

- **D. None:** This option suggests that all the listed conditions can occur, which is not correct based on the analysis above.

Given the analysis, the condition that is least likely to be a direct result of pentamidine therapy is cavitation (Option B).

1120,A person's X-ray chest showing homogenous opacity on right side with shifting of mediastinum on opposite side. Most probable diagnosis is/are:,"['Collapse', 'Pleural effusion', 'Pneumothorax', 'Consolidation']","Let's analyze the given description step by step:

1. **Homogenous opacity on the right side**: This suggests a uniform cloudiness in one part of the chest, which could be caused by various conditions such as fluid, air, or infection.
2. **Shifting of the mediastinum on the opposite side**: This indicates that the mediastinum (the area in the center of the chest that contains vital structures such as the heart and great vessels) is being pushed to the left side. This typically occurs when there is fluid or air in the right pleural space, causing the mediastinum to shift towards the side without the fluid or air.

- **A. Collapse**: Typically, collapse (atelectasis) would not cause homogenous opacity or mediastinal shift in the described manner.
- **B. Pleural effusion**: While pleural effusion can cause a shift of the mediastinum towards the unaffected side, it generally does not cause a homogenous opacity.
- **C. Pneumothorax**: This condition involves air in the pleural space, causing the lung on the affected side to collapse and shift the mediastinum to the opposite side. This matches the description well.
- **D. Consolidation**: Consolidation (pneumonia or other lung infiltrates) can cause homogenous opacity but does not typically cause mediastinal shift.

Given the description of homogenous opacity and mediastinal shift, the most probable diagnosis is **Pneumothorax**.

1122,The structure damaged in the given condition is responsible for all except:,"['Taste sensation of ant 2/3rd tongue', 'Lacrimal gland secretion', 'Parotid gland secretion', 'Platysma contraction']","To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the structure in question and its functions. The options provided relate to various functions controlled by specific nerves.

- Option A refers to the taste sensation of the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue, which is managed by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).
- Option B involves lacrimal gland secretion, which is controlled by the facial nerve as well.
- Option C pertains to parotid gland secretion, which is managed by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX).
- Option D concerns platysma contraction, which is managed by the facial nerve.

The platysma is a muscle that extends from the anterior part of the upper part of the chest to the angle of the mandible. It is innervated by the facial nerve, which also manages the taste sensation of the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue and lacrimal gland secretion. However, the parotid gland is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve, not the facial nerve.

Therefore, the structure damaged in this condition does not affect parotid gland secretion.

If the pooled sample tests negative, then all individual samples within that pool are negative. If the pooled sample tests positive, then each individual sample in the pool is tested separately. This method is particularly useful for screening conditions where the prevalence is low.

Let's evaluate the options:

A. STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) - Some STDs, like HIV, can be tested using cluster testing methods, especially in high-risk populations or screening large groups. However, it is not the primary use case for cluster testing.

B. Diabetes - Diabetes screening typically involves fasting blood glucose tests or other individualized tests, making cluster testing less applicable in this context.

C. Measles - Measles is typically diagnosed through individual serological tests or viral detection methods from individual samples, not through cluster testing.

D. Cancer - Cancer screening, especially for conditions like cervical cancer or certain types of cancer that can be detected through blood biomarkers, can sometimes use cluster testing for initial screening, especially in large populations.

Given the context and application of cluster testing, the most appropriate use among the options provided is for conditions that can be effectively screened using pooled samples, such as some STDs or certain types of cancer.

A. Meta-zoonoses: This is not a standard term in medical literature. It might be a misspelling or a misunderstanding of other terms.

B. Cyclo-zoonoses: This term is also not standard. It might be a misunderstanding or a misspelling of another term.

C. Direct-zoonoses: This refers to diseases that are transmitted directly from animals to humans without an intermediate host. Schistosomiasis is not an example of a direct zoonosis because it involves an intermediate host (snails) in the life cycle of the parasite.

D. Sporo-zoonoses: This term correctly refers to diseases that are caused by spores and that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Schistosomiasis involves the transmission of the parasite Schistosoma through water contaminated with cercariae (the infective stage of the parasite), which are released from infected snails. The disease is not directly transmitted from animal to human but rather through the environment.

1128,Drug of choice for pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"['Dexamethasone', 'Betamethasone', 'Hydrocoisone', 'Prednisolone']","To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the medical condition and the typical treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in a pregnant female.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an inherited disorder of the adrenal glands that can cause an accumulation of cortisol precursors. In pregnant females with a suspected case of CAH in their baby, the treatment often involves administering glucocorticoids to reduce the production of cortisol precursors and prevent salt-wasting crises or other complications.

Dexamethasone is commonly used in prenatal treatment for CAH because it crosses the placenta well and effectively reduces the production of cortisol precursors in the fetus. It is preferred over other glucocorticoids like betamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone due to its optimal placental transfer and effectiveness in reducing the risk of CAH in the baby.

1129,Treatment of hydatid cyst,"['Excision of cyst', 'Percutaneous drainage', 'Conservative management', 'None']","To determine the correct treatment for a hydatid cyst, we need to consider the nature of the condition. Hydatid cysts are caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasitic tapeworm. Treatment options depend on the size, location, and number of cysts.

- **Excision of cyst (Option A)**: This is a surgical approach where the cyst is removed. It is often considered for single, localized cysts but can be challenging due to the risk of releasing daughter cysts during the procedure.

- **Percutaneous drainage (Option B)**: This involves inserting a needle through the skin to drain the cyst. It is less invasive but may not be effective for large or multiple cysts, and recurrence is common.

- **Conservative management (Option C)**: This involves monitoring the cyst without active treatment, often using antiparasitic medications like albendazole. It is suitable for asymptomatic or small, well-localized cysts.

- **None (Option D)**: This suggests no specific treatment, which is not typically the case for symptomatic or large hydatid cysts.

Given these considerations, the best approach often includes a combination of conservative management with antiparasitic drugs and, in some cases, surgical excision or percutaneous drainage, depending on the cyst's characteristics.

On arrival the patient is in a lot of pain and requesting relief immediately. Her cervix is 5 cm dilated. What is most appropriate method of pain control for this patient,"['Intramuscular morphine', 'Pudendal block', 'Local block', 'Epidural block']","Let's analyze the options given for pain control in this pregnant woman at 40 weeks gestational age, with regular uterine contractions every 4-5 minutes and a cervix dilated to 5 cm.

1. **Intramuscular morphine (A)**: While morphine can provide effective analgesia, it can cross the placenta and potentially depress the respiratory function of the fetus. It is generally not the first choice for pain management in labor due to this risk.

2. **Pudendal block (B)**: This involves local anesthesia of the pudendal nerve to provide analgesia for delivery, but it does not provide complete analgesia for labor pains and is often used as an adjunct rather than a primary method.

3. **Local block (C)**: Similar to a pudendal block, local block can provide some relief but is limited in its effectiveness for managing the intensity and frequency of labor pains.

4. **Epidural block (D)**: An epidural block provides a reliable and effective method of pain relief during labor. It involves placing an epidural catheter, which delivers local anesthetics to block pain signals from the lower part of the body, allowing the patient to remain conscious and mobile while providing significant pain relief.

Given that the patient is already in active labor and the pain is significant, the most appropriate method of pain control is one that provides effective analgesia without significant risks to the fetus. The epidural block is the most comprehensive and commonly used method in labor for this purpose.

Which of the following clinical findings is most likely to be characteristic of this group of patients?","['Cachexia', 'Cardiac murmur', 'Icterus', 'Loss of sensation']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given tumor stage (T4N1M1) and the survival rate (less than 50% at 5 years).

- T4: The tumor has invaded adjacent structures.
- N1: Lymph node involvement in one to three ipsilateral lymph nodes.
- M1: Metastasis to distant organs.

Stage T4N1M1 indicates a high stage of cancer with significant metastasis, which often leads to a poor prognosis. Given that the survival rate is less than 50% regardless of therapy, the clinical findings should correlate with advanced cancer and its complications.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A. Cachexia: This is a syndrome characterized by severe weight loss, muscle wasting, and weakness, often seen in advanced cancer due to chronic illness and malnutrition.

B. Cardiac murmur: This could be related to a heart issue but is not a direct consequence of cancer stage T4N1M1.

C. Icterus: This refers to yellowing of the skin and eyes due to jaundice, which can be caused by liver involvement but is not a common direct finding of advanced carcinoma stage.

The next step in management should be","['Electromyography (EMG)', 'Measurement of anterior compartment pressure', 'Elevation of the left leg', 'Immediate fasciotomy']","Let's reason through this step by step:

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 55-year-old man who has recently developed atrial fibrillation and is presenting with symptoms of a cold, pulseless left lower extremity, paresthesia, and inability to dorsiflex his toes. This suggests a potential arterial occlusion leading to ischemia.

2. **Recent Intervention**: He underwent a successful popliteal embolectomy and had his pedal pulses restored. This indicates that the immediate cause of the ischemia (likely a thromboembolic event) has been addressed.

3. **Persistent Symptoms**: Despite the successful embolectomy, the patient still cannot dorsiflex his toes. This suggests that there might be further underlying issues, such as neuromuscular damage or compartment syndrome.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - **Electromyography (EMG)**: This would help assess the functional status of the muscles and nerves but does not address any immediate surgical concerns.
   - **Measurement of Anterior Compartment Pressure**: This is crucial in cases of compartment syndrome, where elevated pressure within the muscle compartments can lead to irreversible muscle and nerve damage if not addressed promptly.
   - **Elevation of the Left Leg**: While elevation can help with swelling and promote venous return, it is not a definitive step to address the persisting symptoms.
   - **Immediate Fasciotomy**: This is an emergency surgical procedure to release the pressure in the muscle compartments if compartment syndrome is suspected. Given the patient's inability to dorsiflex his toes, this indicates potential nerve or muscle damage that requires immediate decompression.

Given the patient's inability to dorsiflex his toes and the possibility of compartment syndrome, the most critical next step is to measure the anterior compartment pressure to assess for potential compartment syndrome.

A decrease in which of the following is the most likely cause of the peripheral edema?,"['Capillary hydrostatic pressure', 'Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure', 'Interstitial hydrostatic pressure', 'Plasma colloid osmotic pressure']","To determine the most likely cause of peripheral edema in a patient with a history of alcoholism and liver disease, let's consider the pathophysiology of edema formation. Edema is typically caused by an imbalance in the filtration and reabsorption of fluid in the capillaries and interstitial space. The main factors influencing this balance are capillary hydrostatic pressure, interstitial colloid osmotic pressure, and interstitial hydrostatic pressure.

1. **Capillary hydrostatic pressure** (Option A): This pressure pushes fluid out of the capillaries into the interstitial space. If there is an increase in this pressure, fluid would be pushed out, potentially causing edema. However, in liver disease, there is often a decrease in this pressure due to portal hypertension, which is a common complication.

2. **Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure** (Option B): This pressure is due to the proteins in the interstitial space, which pull fluid back into the capillaries. A decrease in this pressure would cause fluid to be pulled out of the capillaries, leading to edema. Liver disease can lead to hypoalbuminemia, which decreases the interstitial colloid osmotic pressure.

3. **Interstitial hydrostatic pressure** (Option C): This pressure is usually not a significant factor in the development of edema and is generally not altered in liver disease.

4. **Plasma colloid osmotic pressure** (Option D): This is the osmotic pressure that tends to pull fluid into the capillaries from the interstitial space. A decrease in this pressure would cause fluid to be pulled out of the capillaries, leading to edema. Hypoalbuminemia, a common consequence of liver disease, decreases the plasma colloid osmotic pressure.

Given the history of alcoholism and liver disease, the most likely cause of the peripheral edema is a decrease in the plasma colloid osmotic pressure.

1189,Which of the following analgesics should not be given in acute MI ?,"['Methadone', 'Morphine', 'Buprenorphine', 'Pentazocine']","To determine which analgesic should not be given in acute MI (Myocardial Infarction), we need to consider the safety and appropriateness of each drug in this clinical setting. 

1. **Methadone**: This opioid has a long half-life and can potentially cause respiratory depression, which is a significant risk in acute MI where cardiac output and oxygenation might be compromised. However, it is not commonly used for acute pain management.

2. **Morphine**: This is a commonly used analgesic in acute MI due to its ability to relieve pain and reduce anxiety. It also helps in reducing the workload on the heart by lowering blood pressure and heart rate.

3. **Buprenorphine**: Similar to morphine, buprenorphine is an opioid that can be used for pain relief. It has a lower risk of causing severe respiratory depression compared to full agonists like morphine, making it a safer option in some cases.

4. **Pentazocine**: This is a partial opioid agonist and can cause unpredictable effects, including increased heart rate and blood pressure. In the context of acute MI, where hemodynamic stability is crucial, pentazocine can be risky due to its potential to cause arrhythmias and other cardiovascular complications.

Given these considerations, the analgesic that should not be given in acute MI is Pentazocine.

1192,Fatty acid synthase complex contain the following enzymes except:,"['Enoyl reductase', 'Ketoacyl reductase', 'Acetyl: CoA carboxylase', 'Dehydratase']","To determine which enzyme is not part of the fatty acid synthase complex, let's first understand the components of this complex. Fatty acid synthase is a multi-enzyme complex responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids. It includes enzymes that catalyze different steps in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. These steps include condensation, reduction, dehydration, and thiolysis.

- **Enoyl reductase** and **dehydratase** are indeed part of the fatty acid synthase complex and are involved in the reduction and dehydration steps, respectively.
- **Ketoacyl reductase** is also part of the complex and is involved in a reduction step.
- **Acetyl:CoA carboxylase**, however, is not a part of the fatty acid synthase complex. It is a separate enzyme that catalyzes the first step in fatty acid synthesis, the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is then used by the fatty acid synthase complex.

Therefore, the enzyme that is not part of the fatty acid synthase complex is Acetyl:CoA carboxylase.

1193,Which is the only living pa of Hydatid cyst?,"['Adventitia', 'Germinal epithelium', 'Laminated membrane', 'Parenchyma of the organ']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the structure of a hydatid cyst, which is caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. The cyst has several layers and components, each with a specific function.

- **Adventitia**: This term typically refers to the outermost layer of an organ or tissue. In the context of a hydatid cyst, it is not a specific layer or component.
- **Germinal epithelium**: This layer is responsible for the production of daughter cysts and is crucial for the cyst's ability to spread. It is often considered the vital living part of the hydatid cyst.
- **Laminated membrane**: This is a thick, fibrous layer that surrounds the inner cyst and provides structural support. While important, it is not the living part.
- **Parenchyma of the organ**: This term typically refers to the functional tissue of an organ. In the context of a hydatid cyst, it is not an appropriate term.

Given the above, the germinal epithelium is the only living part of the hydatid cyst as it is responsible for the production and spread of the cyst.

1200,Osmotic fragility is increased in ?,"['Sickle cell anaemia', 'Thalassemia', 'Hereditary spherocytosis', 'Chronic lead poisoning']","Osmotic fragility refers to the ability of red blood cells to withstand exposure to different concentrations of salt (sodium chloride) solutions. Red blood cells with high osmotic fragility are more prone to rupture when exposed to low osmotic pressure environments.

- Sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia are conditions characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, which affects the shape and function of red blood cells but does not primarily affect their osmotic fragility.
- Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder where red blood cells are shaped like spheres instead of discs. These spherocytes have a smaller surface area and are more susceptible to osmotic lysis, leading to increased osmotic fragility.
- Chronic lead poisoning can cause anemia and affect red blood cell function but does not directly increase osmotic fragility in the way that hereditary spherocytosis does.

Therefore, the condition that is characterized by increased osmotic fragility is hereditary spherocytosis.

1202,"According to WHO, what is given to prevent PPH by active management of third stage of labour?","['IV PGF2 alpha agonist', 'IM oxytocin', 'IV ergometrine', 'Perrectal prostaglandins']","To answer this question, let's first understand what PPH (Postpartum Hemorrhage) is and the active management strategy for preventing it during the third stage of labor. PPH is the excessive blood loss from the uterus after childbirth, typically defined as more than 500 mL after the first birth or more than 1000 mL after subsequent births. WHO guidelines recommend active management of the third stage of labor to prevent PPH.

The active management of the third stage of labor involves the administration of a uterotonic agent to help the uterus contract and reduce bleeding. WHO guidelines recommend the use of oxytocin as the uterotonic of choice for active management of the third stage of labor. Oxytocin can be given intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV).

Now, let's look at the options provided:
A. IV PGF2 alpha agonist - This is not commonly used for the active management of the third stage of labor.
B. IM oxytocin - This is a recommended uterotonic for active management of the third stage of labor.

- **Tachycardia**: Increased heart rate.
- **Fever**: Elevated body temperature.
- **Hepatosplenomegaly**: Enlarged liver and spleen.
- **Pallor**: Pale skin, often due to low hemoglobin levels.

These symptoms are characteristic of malaria, especially in pregnant women. Malaria is a parasitic infection caused by Plasmodium species, which can lead to these systemic symptoms. The enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) are often seen in malaria due to the infection and the body's immune response. Additionally, the pallor and tachycardia can be due to the anemia often associated with malaria.

Now, let's consider the other options:

- **B. Iron deficiency anaemia**: While this can cause pallor and tachycardia, it is less likely to cause hepatosplenomegaly.
- **C. Physiological anaemia**: This is a normal condition during pregnancy due to increased blood volume, and does not typically cause hepatosplenomegaly or fever.
- **D. Megaloblastic anaemia**: This is usually due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, which would not typically cause hepatosplenomegaly or fever.

Given the combination of symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is malaria.

1211,Intermediate host for hydatid disease:,"['Man', 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Foxes']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what an intermediate host is in the context of parasites. An intermediate host is a non-definitive host in the life cycle of a parasite, in which the parasite undergoes a stage of its life cycle but does not reach its adult stage.

Hydatid disease, also known as echinococcosis, is caused by the larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The definitive host is typically a dog (or other carnivores) that excretes the tapeworm eggs in its feces. When these eggs are ingested by an intermediate host, such as a sheep or goat, the larvae develop into cysts in the tissues of the intermediate host.

Given this information, the intermediate host for hydatid disease is any animal that can ingest the tapeworm eggs and develop cysts, but the most common and significant intermediate host is sheep or other livestock.

Among the options provided, none directly mentions sheep or livestock. However, we can infer that any of these animals could potentially serve as an intermediate host if exposed to the tapeworm eggs. Since the question asks for the most common or definitive intermediate host, and considering that the options do not include ""sheep"" or ""livestock,"" we need to choose the most relevant option based on common knowledge and the life cycle of the parasite.

A sacrococcygeal teratoma is a type of birth defect that involves the development of a mass at the base of the tailbone (sacrum and coccyx). These tumors are usually benign but can be complex and may be associated with other congenital anomalies.

Meningocele is a condition where the membrane covering the spinal cord (meninges) protrudes through a spinal defect. While both conditions are associated with neural tube defects, a sacrococcygeal teratoma is not specifically linked to meningocele.

Cardiac defects can occur with a variety of congenital conditions but are not specifically associated with sacrococcygeal teratomas.

Hepatic cysts are benign cystic structures within the liver and are unrelated to sacrococcygeal teratomas.

Cystic adenoid malformation, also known as a branchial cleft cyst, is a type of cyst that can form in the neck region. However, it is not specifically associated with sacrococcygeal teratomas.

Sacrococcygeal teratomas are often associated with other congenital anomalies, including sacral spina bifida, which can lead to meningomyelocele (a type of meningocele where the spinal cord is also involved).

In this case of poisoning:","['Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NH4Cl, an acidifying agent', 'Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NaHCO 3, an alkalinizing agent', 'More of the drug would be ionized at blood pH than at stomach pH', 'Absorption of the drug would be faster from the stomach than from the small intestine.']","To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the properties of antihistaminic drugs that are weak bases. Weak bases are less ionized in an acidic environment and more ionized in a basic environment. When a weak base drug is taken, it is primarily in the non-ionized form in the acidic environment of the stomach, allowing for more efficient absorption. However, once it reaches the more alkaline environment of the bloodstream, it becomes more ionized and less able to cross cell membranes.

Given that the drug is a weak base, it would be more ionized in the basic environment of the blood (pH of blood is around 7.4) compared to the acidic environment of the stomach (pH around 1.5 to 3.5). Therefore, option C is incorrect because more of the drug would be ionized in the blood than in the stomach, which would reduce its absorption.

Now, considering the options:
A. Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NH4Cl, an acidifying agent. Administering an acidifying agent would make the urine more acidic, which would favor the non-ionized form of the weak base drug. This would accelerate its excretion through the urine, making this a plausible option.

B. Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NaHCO3, an alkalinizing agent. Administering an alkalinizing agent would make the urine more basic, which would favor the ionized form of the weak base drug. This would not accelerate its excretion through the urine, making this option incorrect.

C. More of the drug would be ionized at blood pH than at stomach pH. As we discussed, this is true but does not directly relate to the excretion rate.

D. Absorption of the drug would be faster from the stomach than from the small intestine. This is incorrect because weak base drugs are more absorbed in the more acidic environment of the stomach.

1311,The cuspal inclines of the maxillary buccal cusps and the mandibular lingual cusps should be grounded if they are in deflective occlusal contact in:,"['Working position only', 'Balancing position only', 'Both working and balancing positions', 'Central position']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand the terms involved:

1. **Working position**: This is the position of the mandible during functional movements, such as chewing, where the cusps of the teeth interdigitate and create occlusal contacts.
2. **Balancing position**: This is the position of the mandible when the teeth are in contact with no muscle tension, and the condyles are seated in the sockets.
3. **Central position**: This is the position of the mandible when the teeth are in contact with the upper and lower teeth in the center, without any lateral or protrusive movements.
4. **Deflective occlusal contact**: This occurs when a cusp of one tooth contacts a non-cuspal area (e.g., the buccal cusp of the maxillary first molar contacts the lingual cusp tip of the mandibular first molar) during functional movements, leading to a deflective force.

Given that the question asks about deflective occlusal contact involving the maxillary buccal cusps and the mandibular lingual cusps, it is important to note that such contacts occur during functional movements, specifically in the working position. The balancing and central positions are static and do not typically involve the same type of deflective contact.

Therefore, the cuspal inclines of the maxillary buccal cusps and the mandibular lingual cusps should be grounded if they are in deflective occlusal contact in the working position only.

1. **Patient Presentation and Mass Characteristics:**
   - A 20-year-old female patient with a 6x6x6 cm ovarian mass.
   - The ultrasonography reveals solid structures in the mass, which is a significant clue.

2. **Serum Biomarkers:**
   - Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is normal, which rules out endodermal sinus tumor (B) and malignant teratoma (C).
   - Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) is normal, which further rules out endodermal sinus tumor (B) and malignant teratoma (C).
   - Serum CA 125 is normal, which rules out certain types of ovarian cancer, including malignant teratoma (C).

3. **Serum Alkaline Phosphatase:**
   - Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase can be a marker for certain types of ovarian tumors, including dysgerminoma (A) and malignant teratoma (C).

4. **Diagnosis Consideration:**
   - Dysgerminoma (A) is a type of germ cell tumor that commonly presents as a solid mass in premenopausal women and can elevate alkaline phosphatase levels.
   - Malignant teratoma (C) can also elevate alkaline phosphatase but is less likely given the normal AFP and hCG levels.

As per new Bronchopulmonary dysplasia definition, he has which of the following –","['Mild BPD', 'Moderate BPD', 'Severe BPD', 'No BPD']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the criteria for diagnosing Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. BPD is typically defined based on the duration of oxygen therapy and/or mechanical ventilation after birth, especially in very low gestational age infants.

For a baby born at 27 weeks of gestation, the criteria for BPD can be summarized as follows:
- No BPD: If the infant does not require oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.
- Mild BPD: If the infant requires oxygen for 21-30 days at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.
- Moderate BPD: If the infant requires oxygen for 31-90 days at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.
- Severe BPD: If the infant requires oxygen for more than 90 days at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.

Given the scenario:
- The baby was on mechanical ventilation for the first 4 weeks.
- The baby was on oxygen for the next week (5 weeks total on oxygen).
- The baby was maintained at room temperature subsequently, implying no further respiratory support.

Since the baby required oxygen for 5 weeks, and this is within the range of 21-30 days, the diagnosis would be Mild BPD.

A. Ba enema: This is a diagnostic procedure where barium, a contrast material, is administered to visualize the intestines. While it can be useful, it is more typically used in a more chronic or non-acute setting to visualize the entire intestinal tract. In an acute setting, it may not be the first choice due to the need to move the contrast through the bowel, which can exacerbate symptoms.

B. X-ray abdomen erect posture: This is a quick and non-invasive method to assess for bowel obstruction. It can often show dilated bowel loops and air-fluid levels, which are indicative of obstruction. It is a common initial step in the evaluation of an acutely abdomen-painful patient.

C. USG (Ultrasound): While useful, ultrasound may not be as sensitive or specific as other imaging modalities for detecting small bowel obstruction. It is more often used for other conditions such as appendicitis or ovarian cysts.

D. CT scan: This is a highly sensitive and specific imaging modality for diagnosing bowel obstruction. It provides detailed images and can help in differentiating between various causes of obstruction. However, it is more invasive and time-consuming compared to an X-ray.

Considering the acute nature of the symptoms and the need for a quick initial assessment, the most appropriate initial investigation is an X-ray abdomen erect posture.

1333,Gradient in pulmonary aery wedge pressure and left ventricular end diastolic pressure is seen in,"['Aoic regurgitation', 'Constrictive pericarditis', 'Left atrial myxoma', 'Pulmonary thromboembolism']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the relationship between pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in the context of the given options.

- **Aortic regurgitation**: This condition involves leakage of blood from the aortic valve back into the left ventricle during diastole. It does not directly affect the relationship between PAWP and LVEDP.

- **Constrictive pericarditis**: This condition involves a stiff pericardium that restricts ventricular filling. This can lead to an elevation in both PAWP and LVEDP, but the pressures are typically high and synchronous, not a gradient.

- **Left atrial myxoma**: This is a benign tumor of the left atrium. It can obstruct blood flow into the left ventricle, leading to an elevated PAWP and a higher LVEDP, but again, the pressures are not in a gradient.

- **Pulmonary thromboembolism**: This condition involves a blockage in the pulmonary arteries, leading to an increased PAWP and an elevated LVEDP. However, the key characteristic here is that the PAWP is significantly higher than the LVEDP due to the obstruction in the pulmonary vasculature, creating a gradient.

Given the above explanations, the condition that specifically involves a gradient between PAWP and LVEDP is pulmonary thromboembolism.

Lately the child has also staed having trouble in walking along with frequent mood changes and excessive thirst. MRI brain showed a tumour in the sellar region which was resected. HPE examination showed reticular epithelial cells that have appearances reminiscent of the enamel pulp of developing teeth along with calcifications and wet keratin nodules. The gene involved in causing the above condition is also involved in causing which other condition: -,"['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Melanoma', 'Neuroblastoma', 'CML']","The clinical presentation of the patient includes sho stature, headaches, vision loss, difficulty in walking, mood changes, and excessive thirst. The MRI brain shows a tumor in the sellar region, and the histopathological examination reveals reticular epithelial cells with features reminiscent of developing tooth enamel, calcifications, and wet keratin nodules. This presentation is characteristic of Carney Complex, a rare hereditary condition.

Carney Complex is caused by mutations in the PRKAR1A gene, which is also associated with other conditions such as pulmonary chondromas and mucocutaneous lentigos. Among the given options, no condition is directly linked to PRKAR1A mutations, but we need to find which of the given conditions is associated with the same gene or a similar genetic pathway. 

CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) is not directly related to PRKAR1A mutations. Hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and neuroblastoma are not directly linked to PRKAR1A mutations either. However, considering the options and the genetic association, the closest match for a condition associated with PRKAR1A mutations is CML, as both conditions can be related to mutations in genes that regulate the cAMP signaling pathway.

The patient denies having any problems and seems indifferent to his wife's concern. He has a medical history of hypeension and type 2 diabetes mellitus There is a family history of Alzheimer disease. On MMSE, score came out to be 23. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","['Alzheimer disease', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease', 'Dementia with Lewy bodies', 'Frontotemporal dementia']","Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and the given options:

1. **Forgetfulness**: The patient is experiencing increasing forgetfulness, particularly regarding organizing finances and paying bills, which are tasks he used to handle well.
2. **Withdrawal and Social Isolation**: He has become more withdrawn and has decreased in social interactions.
3. **Inappropriate Behavior**: The patient exhibited inappropriate behavior with a female neighbor, which is not characteristic of his usual behavior.

5. **Cognitive Assessment**: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score is 23, which is below the normal range.

Now, let's consider the options:

- **A. Alzheimer disease**: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that typically presents with memory loss, cognitive decline, and changes in behavior. The family history of Alzheimer's disease and the patient's symptoms align well with this diagnosis.
  
- **B. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease**: This is a rare, rapidly progressive form of dementia that usually presents with rapidly deteriorating cognitive and motor functions, often with myoclonus and visual disturbances. The patient's symptoms do not suggest a rapid progression or myoclonus, making this less likely.
  
- **C. Dementia with Lewy bodies**: This form of dementia often presents with visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and fluctuations in alertness and cognition. The patient's inappropriate behavior and cognitive decline are not strongly indicative of this condition.
  
- **D. Frontotemporal dementia**: This type of dementia primarily affects behavior, personality, and language. While the inappropriate behavior and social withdrawal are relevant, the cognitive decline and memory issues are more commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Given the patient's symptoms, family history, and cognitive assessment score, the most likely diagnosis is Alzheimer disease.

which of the following is the most likely location of the patient’s lesion?","['Left abducens nerve', 'Left abducens nucleus and left medial longitudinal fasciculus', 'Right abducens nerve', 'Right abducens nucleus and right medial longitudinal fasciculus']","Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and the options provided:

- The patient has double vision, indicating a problem with eye movement.
- The patient cannot adduct (move towards the nose) or abduct (move away from the nose) his right eye.
- Additionally, the patient cannot adduct his left eye.

This suggests a problem with both the right and left abducens nerves, as the right abducens nerve controls the right eye's abduction, and the left abducens nerve controls the left eye's abduction. However, the involvement of both eyes indicates a higher-level lesion that affects both sides.

The abducens nucleus is involved in the motor control of the lateral rectus muscle, which controls the eye's abduction. A lesion in the abducens nucleus would affect both eyes' ability to abduct.

The medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the contralateral abducens nucleus to the ipsilateral oculomotor nucleus, facilitating eye movements. A lesion in the MLF would affect the ability to abduct both eyes due to the connection between the abducens nucleus and the oculomotor nucleus.

Given the patient's inability to adduct both eyes, the most likely location of the lesion is in the left abducens nucleus (which controls the right eye) and the left MLF, which affects the left eye's abducens nucleus and thus the right eye's abduction.

1376,All of the following are precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease except,"['Hypokalemia', 'Hyponatremia', 'Hypoxia', 'Metabolic acidosis']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what precipitating factors can cause hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with chronic liver disease. HE is typically caused by the accumulation of toxic substances, primarily ammonia, due to impaired liver function.

- **Hypokalemia** (low potassium levels) can lead to metabolic alkalosis, which can increase the brain's sensitivity to toxic substances, thus potentially precipitating HE.
- **Hyponatremia** (low sodium levels) can cause cellular edema, which can affect brain function, potentially leading to HE.
- **Hypoxia** (low oxygen levels) can directly impair brain function and is a known precipitating factor for HE.
- **Metabolic acidosis** can alter the body's electrolyte balance and impair liver function, which can contribute to HE.

The option that is not a direct precipitating factor for HE, unlike the others, is metabolic acidosis, as it is more about electrolyte imbalance and less about direct impairment of brain function through toxic substance accumulation.

1386,Cells are most radio-resistant in,"['S phase', 'M phase', 'G1 phase', 'G2 phase']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the cell cycle phases and the sensitivity of cells to radiation. 

- The S phase (Synthesis phase) is when DNA replication occurs. Cells are more sensitive to radiation during DNA synthesis because the replication process is error-prone and radiation can cause more damage to the newly synthesized DNA.
- The M phase (Mitosis) is the phase where the cell divides. Cells are highly vulnerable during this phase because of the complexity and fragility of the mitotic spindle.
- The G1 phase (Gap 1 phase) is the first gap phase where the cell grows and checks for DNA damage before entering the S phase. Cells are relatively resistant to radiation during this phase.
- The G2 phase (Gap 2 phase) is the second gap phase where the cell continues to grow and prepares for mitosis. Cells are less sensitive to radiation than in the S and M phases but more sensitive than in the G1 phase.

Given this information, cells are most radio-resistant in the G1 phase because they have not yet replicated their DNA and are less complex in terms of division processes.

1388,DIC is seen most commonly seen in which ANIL type?,"['M2', 'M3', 'M4', 'M5']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) is and its association with ANLL (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) types.

DIC is a condition where widespread clotting of blood occurs in small blood vessels, leading to the consumption of clotting factors and platelets. It is commonly seen in various conditions including certain types of leukemia, particularly those with a high level of tumor burden.

ANLL is classified into different subtypes (M0 to M7) based on the maturity of the leukemic cells. DIC is more commonly associated with certain subtypes of ANLL that have a higher incidence of complications such as bleeding or clotting disorders.

- M2: This subtype is characterized by intermediate maturation of myeloblasts and is less commonly associated with DIC.
- M3: This subtype, also known as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), has a high risk of developing DIC due to the presence of specific genetic abnormalities like t(15;17) that can lead to the production of immature promyelocytes that can cause microthrombi.
- M4: This subtype is characterized by maturation of myeloblasts to the promyelocyte stage but has a variable risk for DIC.
- M5: This subtype involves the monocytic lineage and has a variable risk for DIC.

Given the information, M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) is the subtype most commonly associated with DIC due to the specific genetic abnormalities that can lead to the condition.

1431,"All of the following are features of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), except:","['Fever', 'Splenomegaly', 'Hyperferritinemia', 'Hyperfibrinogenemia']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand the features of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is characterized by a severe and uncontrolled immune response that leads to widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction. Common features of HLH include fever, hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen), neurologic abnormalities, coagulation disorders, and hyperferritinemia (elevated ferritin levels).

Now, let's analyze each option:

A. Fever - This is a common feature of HLH due to the hyperinflammatory state.
B. Splenomegaly - This is also a common feature of HLH as the spleen becomes enlarged due to the immune response.
C. Hyperferritinemia - Elevated ferritin levels are a hallmark of HLH, reflecting the body's response to inflammation.
D. Hyperfibrinogenemia - This term refers to elevated levels of fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clotting. While coagulation disorders are a feature of HLH, hyperfibrinogenemia itself is not a typical feature but rather a result of the coagulation process during the disease.

Given this analysis, the feature that is not a direct characteristic of HLH but rather a consequence of the disease process is hyperfibrinogenemia.

Anthropozoonosis is a disease that can be transmitted from humans to animals or from animals to humans.

A. Rabies - This is a viral disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans, making it an anthropozoonosis.
B. Plaque - It seems there might be a typo in the option. If it's meant to be ""Plague,"" it is an anthropozoonosis caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which can be transmitted between animals and humans.
C. Anthrax - This is a bacterial disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans, making it an anthropozoonosis.
D. Schistosomiasis - This is a parasitic disease primarily transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated water, and it can also be transmitted from humans to snails, making it an anthropozoonosis.

Given the analysis, the option that does not fit the definition of an anthropozoonosis is the one with a typo or an incorrect match in the context of the disease being transmissible between humans and animals. Since the term ""Plaque"" does not correctly represent a known disease, and considering the context of the question, the correct answer would be B, assuming ""Plaque"" is a typo for ""Plague.""

1441,"A patient presents with Hb of 8 gm%, WBC count of 2000/mm3 and platlet count of 60000/mm3. What is your likely diagnosis ?","['Thalassemia', 'Sickle cell anemia', 'Aplastic anemia', 'Anemia of chronic disease']","Let's analyze the given laboratory results:

- Hemoglobin (Hb): 8 gm% - This indicates severe anemia, as normal Hb levels are typically around 13-18 gm% for men and 12-16 gm% for women.
- White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 2000/mm³ - This is extremely low, indicating a severe reduction in the number of white blood cells, which could be due to bone marrow suppression or severe infection.
- Platelet count: 60000/mm³ - This is also low, suggesting bone marrow suppression, as platelet production is also dependent on the bone marrow.

Given these findings, we need to consider which condition would present with all of these symptoms:

- **A. Thalassemia**: This condition primarily affects hemoglobin synthesis and typically does not cause such severe leukopenia (low WBC count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
- **B. Sickle cell anemia**: This condition also affects hemoglobin but usually does not cause such profound bone marrow suppression.
- **C. Aplastic anemia**: This condition directly affects the bone marrow, leading to severe suppression of all blood cell lines (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), which matches the patient’s findings.
- **D. Anemia of chronic disease**: This condition usually presents with normocytic or microcytic anemia but does not typically cause severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

Based on the severe bone marrow suppression indicated by the very low WBC and platelet counts, the most likely diagnosis is aplastic anemia.

1442,The normal time required to culture mycobacterium TB is :,"['4-8 weeks', '2-3 weeks', '6-10 weeks', '21 days']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the typical growth characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. TB). M. TB is known for its slow growth rate, which is a key distinguishing feature compared to other bacteria. The standard culture method for M. TB involves the use of a liquid medium or an agar-based medium, both of which require a long incubation period to observe the growth of the bacteria.

Given the slow growth rate, a culture period of 2-3 weeks (option B) would be too short, as it is generally acknowledged that M. TB requires at least several weeks to become visible in the culture medium. On the other hand, a period of 21 days (option D) is also too short, as M. TB typically takes longer than a month to grow visibly.

Option C (6-10 weeks) is a more reasonable estimate but might still be considered long for routine clinical purposes, where faster results are often desired.

Option A (4-8 weeks) is widely recognized as the standard time required for the culture of M. TB, aligning with the slow growth rate of the bacterium.

1463,Mrs A is hesitant about having children because her two sisters had sons who had died from kinky hair disease. Her mother's brother also died of the same condition. What is the mode of inheritance of kinky hair disease which is running in this family?,"['X-linked recessive', 'X-linked dominant', 'Autosomal recessive', 'Autosomal dominant']","To determine the mode of inheritance for kinky hair disease in this family, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Family History**:
   - Mrs. A's two sisters had sons who died from the disease.
   - Mrs. A's mother's brother also died from the same condition.

2. **Patterns to Note**:
   - The disease affects males, and it is passed down to their sons.
   - There is no mention of the disease affecting the mother's daughters or sisters, which would be expected in an X-linked inheritance pattern.
   - The disease manifests in multiple generations and affects males, suggesting it is not an X-linked dominant condition, as that would typically affect all females and their sons.

3. **Possible Inheritance Patterns**:
   - **X-linked recessive**: Males are more likely to express the disease since they only have one X chromosome. Females would need to inherit the recessive allele from both parents to express the disease, which is less likely given the pattern observed.
   - **X-linked dominant**: This would affect both males and females, and females would typically be affected more frequently than males. Given that the disease is seen in multiple males in this family, this is less likely.
   - **Autosomal recessive**: Both parents would need to be carriers (each having one copy of the recessive allele) for the disease to manifest in their children. This fits the pattern where multiple sons are affected but not the daughters, and it can skip generations.
   - **Autosomal dominant**: This would typically result in the disease being expressed in every generation, and both males and females would be affected equally. The pattern in this family does not fit this model.

Given the family history and the patterns observed, the most likely mode of inheritance is **autosomal recessive**.

1484,Adrenal insufficiency in not associated with -,"['Hyponatremia', 'Hyperkalemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Metabolic alkalosis']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to adrenal insufficiency:

- **Hyponatremia**: Adrenal insufficiency often leads to a decrease in aldosterone production, which can cause sodium retention and consequently hyponatremia.
- **Hyperkalemia**: Again, due to reduced aldosterone, potassium retention can occur, leading to hyperkalemia.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Adrenal insufficiency can impair the body’s ability to respond to stress, including the release of glucose from the liver, which can result in hypoglycemia.
- **Metabolic alkalosis**: This condition is characterized by an increase in the blood's pH due to a decrease in carbonic acid or an increase in bicarbonate. Adrenal insufficiency typically does not lead to metabolic alkalosis; rather, it often causes metabolic acidosis due to the inability to maintain electrolyte and acid-base balance.

Given the above reasoning, the correct answer is D.

1523,"Women with PCOS and Hirsutism, management is :","['Ethinyl estradiol', 'Ethinyl estradiol + Cyproterone Acetate', 'Levonorgestrel', 'Ethinyl estradiol + Levonorgestrel']","Let's break down the question and options:

- **PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)**: This condition is characterized by hormonal imbalances, which can lead to symptoms such as irregular menstrual periods, acne, and hirsutism (excessive hair growth).
- **Hirsutism**: This is a condition where women have excessive hair growth on the face, chest, or back, which is often due to increased levels of androgens (male hormones).

For managing PCOS and hirsutism, a combination of medications is often used to address both hormonal imbalances and the symptoms of hirsutism.

- **Option A: Ethinyl estradiol**: This is a form of estrogen used in hormonal contraceptives and can help in regulating menstrual cycles but may not be sufficient for managing hirsutism alone.
- **Option B: Ethinyl estradiol + Cyproterone Acetate**: This combination addresses both estrogen and androgen levels, making it more effective for managing hirsutism and the hormonal imbalances associated with PCOS.
- **Option C: Levonorgestrel**: This is a progestin used in hormonal contraceptives and can help regulate the menstrual cycle but is not as effective for treating hirsutism.
- **Option D: Ethinyl estradiol + Levonorgestrel**: While this combination can regulate the menstrual cycle, it does not specifically address the androgen levels that contribute to hirsutism.

Considering the need to manage both the hormonal imbalances and hirsutism, the most appropriate choice is a combination that includes both estrogen and an anti-androgen.

1524,An upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion involving cranial nerve VII would most likely produce,"['Contralateral weakness of the lower half of the face with sparing of the upper half of the face', 'Decreased gag (pharyngeal) reflex with decreased taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue', 'Hemianesthesia of the face with flaccid paralysis of the muscles of mastication', 'Ipsilateral anosmia with primary amenorrhea in females']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion involving cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve).

- **Option A**: Contralateral weakness of the lower half of the face with sparing of the upper half of the face. UMN lesions typically produce contraindication (i.e., symptoms on the same side as the lesion), not contralateral symptoms. So, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: Decreased gag (pharyngeal) reflex with decreased taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue. This is more consistent with a lower motor neuron (LMN) lesion rather than an UMN lesion. UMN lesions affect the corticospinal tract, leading to symptoms on the same side as the lesion, and do not primarily affect the pharyngeal reflex or taste sensation. So, this option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: Hemianesthesia of the face with flaccid paralysis of the muscles of mastication. Hemianesthesia (loss of sensation on one side of the face) and flaccid paralysis of the muscles of mastication (jaw) are more characteristic of a UMN lesion involving cranial nerve VII, but the muscles of mastication are innervated by the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), not the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). So, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: Ipsilateral anosmia with primary amenorrhea in females. These symptoms are not related to cranial nerve VII, which primarily controls facial expressions and taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. So, this option is incorrect.

Given the analysis, the symptoms most consistent with an UMN lesion involving cranial nerve VII would be the ones that affect the same side of the face and involve facial weakness and possibly facial sensation changes, but not the ones described in the other options. Since none of the other options correctly match the symptoms of an UMN lesion of cranial nerve VII, we need to consider if there's an implied symptom that could fit, which in this case is likely to be a combination of ipsilateral facial weakness and sensory changes.

1532,NADPH actions in RBC are a/e,"['Produce ATP', 'Stabilizes the membrane', 'Reductive biosynthesis', 'GP6D deficiency causes decreased synthesis of NADPH']","Let's analyze each option in the context of NADPH actions in red blood cells (RBCs):

A. Produce ATP - NADPH is not directly involved in ATP production in RBCs. ATP is primarily generated through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and NADPH does not directly participate in these pathways.

B. Stabilizes the membrane - While NADPH is not directly responsible for stabilizing the RBC membrane, its metabolite GSH (glutathione) is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the membrane by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting against membrane lipid peroxidation.

C. Reductive biosynthesis - NADPH is essential for reductive biosynthesis in RBCs, particularly for the synthesis of reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH is vital for maintaining the reducing environment within the RBC, which is necessary for various metabolic processes and detoxification.

D. GP6D deficiency causes decreased synthesis of NADPH - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the enzyme that initiates the pentose phosphate pathway, which is a key source of NADPH production. Therefore, G6PD deficiency would indeed lead to decreased NADPH synthesis, making this statement true.

Given these points, the most accurate statement about NADPH actions in RBCs is related to reductive biosynthesis and the maintenance of GSH levels.

1546,Spatial relationship of every atom in a molecule is known as:,"['Conformation', 'Configuration', 'Both of the above', 'None of the above']","To answer this question, we need to understand the definitions of the terms provided in the options:

- **Conformation**: This term refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule, which can change due to the rotation about single bonds. It involves the arrangement of atoms in a specific way that can change based on the rotation of the molecule.
- **Configuration**: This term is used to describe the arrangement of atoms in a molecule that is stable and cannot be changed by rotation about single bonds. It describes the specific positions of atoms in a molecule relative to each other.

Given these definitions, it is clear that the spatial relationship of every atom in a molecule, which can be changed by rotation, is referred to as conformation. The term ""configuration"" refers to the stable, fixed arrangement of atoms that cannot be changed by rotation.

However, the term ""configuration"" is also used to describe the specific arrangement of atoms in stereoisomers, which is a stable arrangement that cannot be interconverted by rotation about single bonds.

Since conformation specifically refers to the three-dimensional arrangement that can change due to rotation, and configuration includes the stable, fixed arrangement, the term that encompasses both the variable (conformation) and the fixed (configuration) aspects of molecular structure is ""Both of the above.""

1547,"If the prevalene is very low as compared to the incidence for a disease, it implies -","['Disease is very fatal and/or easily curable', 'Disease is nonfatal', 'Calculation of prevalence and incidence is wrong', 'Nothing can be said, as they are independent']","To reason through this question, let's break down the concepts of prevalence and incidence:

- **Prevalence** is the total number of cases of a disease in a given population at a specific time, regardless of when the disease started. It is calculated as the number of existing cases divided by the population size at a specific time.
- **Incidence** is the number of new cases of a disease that occur in a population during a specific time period. It is calculated as the number of new cases divided by the population at risk during the time period.

If prevalence is very low compared to incidence, it means that while many new cases are being diagnosed, these cases are not lasting long enough to be counted in the prevalence statistics. This scenario often occurs with diseases that are:

- **Highly fatal**: If a disease is very fatal, many cases will result in death shortly after diagnosis, leading to a low prevalence.
- **Easily curable**: If a disease can be treated and patients recover quickly, the number of active cases (prevalence) will be low because patients are being cured and no longer counted as cases.

Options analysis:
- A. Disease is very fatal and/or easily curable: This aligns with the scenario described.
- B. Disease is nonfatal: This is not necessarily true because the incidence can still be high if the disease is not fatal but is not curable.
- C. Calculation of prevalence and incidence is wrong: This is not supported by the information given.
- D. Nothing can be said, as they are independent: This is incorrect because prevalence and incidence are related, and a low prevalence compared to incidence can provide important information about the disease.

1552,"The content of base pair A in the DNA is 15%, what could be the amount of G in DNA according to Chargaff's base pair rule?","['15%', '85%', '35%', '70%']","Chargaff's base pair rule states that in double-stranded DNA, the amount of adenine (A) is equal to thymine (T), and the amount of cytosine (C) is equal to guanine (G). This means that the percentages of A and T are the same, and the percentages of C and G are the same.

Given that the content of base pair A is 15%, the content of base pair T must also be 15%. Therefore, the combined content of A and T is 30% (15% + 15%).

Since the total percentage of all bases in DNA must equal 100%, the combined percentage of C and G must be 70% (100% - 30%).

Given that the percentages of C and G are equal, the percentage of G would be half of 70%, which is 35%.

1576,True about leimyosarcoma breast,"['Axillary lymph mode dissection is mandatory', 'Well encapsulated', 'Follow up not required', 'Mastectomy is mainstay treatment']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of leimyosarcoma of the breast:

A. Axillary lymph node dissection is mandatory: Leimyosarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma and the treatment for it is typically localized to the site of the tumor. Lymph node dissection is not mandatory unless there is clinical or imaging evidence of lymph node involvement. 

B. Well encapsulated: Leimyosarcomas are often not well encapsulated, and they tend to be infiltrative rather than well-defined masses. This characteristic is more typical of benign or borderline conditions.

C. Follow up not required: This is incorrect because follow-up is always necessary for any malignancy to monitor for recurrence or metastasis.

D. Mastectomy is mainstay treatment: While surgical excision is a key component of treatment for leimyosarcoma, the mainstay of treatment is typically wide local excision or mastectomy, depending on the extent of the tumor. However, the statement ""mainstay treatment"" might imply it is the only or primary method, which is an overstatement.

Considering the options, the most accurate statement is that lymph node dissection is not mandatory unless there is evidence of lymph node involvement, which aligns with the principle of not mandating a procedure without clinical indication.

1578,What is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome,"['Reduced plasma protein', 'Sodium and water retention', 'Increased venous pressure', 'Hyperlipidemia']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down each option in the context of nephrotic syndrome:

1. **Option A: Reduced plasma protein** - Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by massive proteinuria, leading to a significant reduction in plasma proteins, particularly albumin. This reduced plasma protein concentration increases osmotic pressure in the blood, resulting in fluid leakage into the interstitial space and causing edema.

2. **Option B: Sodium and water retention** - While sodium and water retention can occur in various renal conditions and contribute to edema, it is not the primary pathology of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is primarily due to the loss of proteins, not the retention of sodium and water.

3. **Option C: Increased venous pressure** - Although increased venous pressure can contribute to edema, it is not the primary cause in nephrotic syndrome. The primary mechanism involves the loss of plasma proteins, not increased venous pressure.

4. **Option D: Hyperlipidemia** - Hyperlipidemia (elevated blood lipids) is a common finding in nephrotic syndrome but is a result of the condition, not the cause of edema. The edema is primarily due to the loss of plasma proteins.

Given these explanations, the primary cause of edema in nephrotic syndrome is the reduced plasma protein, particularly albumin.

1581,A 70 year old male chronic smoker is diagnosed of having cancer of the urinary bladder. It is confined to the trigone and extention is upto the submucosa. The management would be -,"['Complete Transurethral resction', 'Complete Transurethral resection with intravesical chemotherapy', 'Palliative Radiotherapy', 'Radical Cystectomy']","To determine the best management for a 70-year-old male chronic smoker diagnosed with bladder cancer confined to the trigone and extending to the submucosa, we need to consider the tumor stage and the patient's overall health.

Given the tumor stage (T2, extending to the submucosa), the standard of care would typically involve more aggressive treatment than transurethral resection, which is usually reserved for smaller, superficial tumors (T1). Palliative radiotherapy is an option for patients with advanced disease or those unsuitable for surgery, but it is not the first-line treatment for this stage of bladder cancer.

Radical cystectomy is the most definitive treatment for bladder cancer that has extended beyond the mucosa, as it involves the removal of the bladder and surrounding structures, which is necessary for curative intent in this case. However, this is a major surgery with significant morbidity and is typically reserved for earlier stages unless there are contraindications.

Complete transurethral resection (TURBT) is a common initial step in the management of bladder cancer to stage the disease, but it is not sufficient for curative intent in this case given the tumor stage.

Complete transurethral resection with intravesical chemotherapy is a treatment approach for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (T1), but this patient's tumor extends to the submucosa (T2), so this approach is not appropriate.

Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient, given the tumor stage and the need for curative intent, would be radical cystectomy.

The most likely diagnosis is -,"['Pituitary adenoma', 'Craniopharyngioma', 'Hypothalamic glioma', 'Benign intracranial hypertension']","To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the symptoms and physical findings provided:

1. **Amenorrhoea**: This suggests a hormonal issue, possibly related to the pituitary gland.
2. **Impaired vision of six months' duration**: This indicates a potential issue affecting the optic nerves or visual pathways.
3. **Pale optic discs and diminished visual acuity**: These are classic signs of increased intracranial pressure, often seen in conditions like pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, or other conditions affecting the sellar region.

Given these symptoms, let's consider the options:

- **A. Pituitary adenoma**: Can cause hormonal imbalances (leading to amenorrhoea) and may exert pressure on the optic nerves, leading to visual impairment. It often results in pale optic discs and can cause visual field defects.
- **B. Craniopharyngioma**: This is a benign tumor that can cause hormonal imbalances and visual disturbances. It can also cause optic nerve compression, leading to visual field defects and optic disc pallor.
- **C. Hypothalamic glioma**: While this can cause hormonal imbalances, it is less commonly associated with visual disturbances and optic disc changes in a primary presentation.
- **D. Benign intracranial hypertension (Pseudotumor cerebri)**: This condition can cause visual disturbances due to optic nerve compression but typically does not present with amenorrhoea as a primary symptom.

Given the combination of hormonal symptoms and visual disturbances, the most likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma, as it can cause both amenorrhoea and visual disturbances due to compression of the optic nerves.

Pale infarct is seen in all of the following organs, EXCEPT:","['Hea', 'Spleen', 'Lung', 'Kidney']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context of pale infarction. Infarction refers to a condition where tissue dies due to a lack of blood supply. The color of the infarct depends on the underlying blood supply and the rate at which the blood flow is restored. Pale infarction indicates that the tissue has a poor blood supply and the infarct appears pale due to the lack of hemoglobin-rich blood.

1. **Heart (Option A)**: The heart has a rich blood supply through the coronary arteries. However, when a coronary artery is blocked, the area supplied by that artery can suffer from pale infarction due to the lack of blood flow.

2. **Spleen (Option B)**: The spleen also has a good blood supply, but it can suffer from pale infarction if there is a blockage in the splenic artery.

3. **Lung (Option C)**: The lung is highly vascularized, with blood supply from the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary infarction is less common but can occur, and in such cases, it would typically appear dark (due to the presence of deoxygenated blood) rather than pale.

4. **Kidney (Option D)**: The kidneys have a good blood supply through the renal arteries. When a renal artery is blocked, it can result in pale infarction.

Based on this analysis, the organ where pale infarction is least likely to be observed is the lung.

A commonly used formula is the Revised Harris-Benedict Equation, but for simplicity, we can use a simpler approach based on the child's weight.

For children, a general rule of thumb is that the daily calorie requirement is approximately 100 to 140 kcal per kg of body weight. This range can be used to estimate the calorie requirement.

1. Using 100 kcal/kg:
   15 kg * 100 kcal/kg = 1500 kcal

2. Using 140 kcal/kg:
   15 kg * 140 kcal/kg = 2100 kcal

Given the options, the most reasonable estimate would be closer to 140 kcal/kg, as it's a commonly used lower end of the range for children.

Therefore, the calorie requirement for a 15 kg child would be approximately 140 kcal/kg, which gives us 1450 kcal.

- **Labetalol (Option A):** This is a mixed alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. It is effective in lowering blood pressure and can be used in labor to manage acute hypertension.

- **Nitroprusside (Option B):** This drug is a potent vasodilator that works quickly to reduce blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels. It is commonly used in the treatment of acute hypertension and can be administered during labor.

- **Hydralazine (Option C):** This is a direct-acting vasodilator that works by relaxing the smooth muscles in blood vessels, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. It is also used to manage acute hypertension during labor.

- **Esmolol (Option D):** This is a short-acting beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. While it can reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline, its use in acute hypertension during labor is generally avoided because it can also affect uterine contractions and fetal heart rate.

1609,All of the following benzodiazepines can be used in the elderly and those with liver disease EXCEPT:,"['Lorazepam', 'Oxazepam', 'Triazolam', 'Diazepam']","To determine which benzodiazepine should be excluded, let's consider the pharmacological properties and common usage of each:

- **Lorazepam**: This benzodiazepine is metabolized by the liver, but it has a long half-life and is often used in the elderly and those with liver disease due to its long duration of action and lower risk of respiratory depression.
- **Oxazepam**: This is a prodrug that is metabolized to oxazepam glucuronide, which is less active and less likely to cause sedation or respiratory depression. It is widely used in the elderly and those with liver disease.
- **Triazolam**: This benzodiazepine is rapidly metabolized and has a short half-life, but it can cause significant sedation and respiratory depression, making it less suitable for the elderly and those with liver disease.
- **Diazepam**: While it is metabolized by the liver, it can be used in the elderly and those with liver disease, though with caution due to its potential to cause sedation and respiratory depression.

Considering these factors, Triazolam (C) is the benzodiazepine that is generally avoided in the elderly and those with liver disease due to its rapid onset and short half-life leading to a higher risk of sedation and respiratory depression.

A. Fusion beats: These are characteristic of VT as they indicate the presence of both atrial and ventricular activity, which is common in VT.

B. Extreme left axis deviation: While left axis deviation can be seen in various arrhythmias, it is not specific to VT. VT can present with a variety of axis deviations, including left axis deviation, but this feature is not exclusive to VT.

C. Very broad QRS complexes (> 140 ms): This is a hallmark of VT, as VT typically presents with wide QRS complexes due to the abnormal electrical activity originating in the ventricles.

D. Non response to carotid sinus massage: Carotid sinus massage is used to differentiate VT from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Since VT does not respond to this maneuver, this is a feature that supports VT as the cause of BCT.

Given the analysis, option B (Extreme left axis deviation) is the feature that does not exclusively favor VT as the cause of BCT.

It is a characteristic feature of females and is not typically seen in males or individuals with conditions that do not involve an extra X chromosome or an absence of one.

- **Turner syndrome (Option A)**: This condition is characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome (45,X). The absence of a second X chromosome means there is no additional X chromosome to condense into a Barr body.
- **Klinefelter syndrome (Option B)**: This condition involves the presence of one or more extra X chromosomes in males (most commonly 47,XXY). In this case, the presence of an extra X chromosome would result in the presence of one or more Barr bodies.
- **Testicular feminization syndrome (Option C)**: This condition (also known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome) involves a genetic male (46,XY) who cannot respond to androgens. The individual will have external female genitalia but internal male reproductive organs. The Barr body would still be present due to the presence of an X chromosome.
- **46 XY (Option D)**: This is a normal male karyotype. Males have two X and one Y chromosome (46,XY). There is no Barr body present as the Y chromosome does not condense into a Barr body.

Given this reasoning, the Barr body is not seen in 46,XY individuals.

1626,Spinal anaesthesia in an adult is given at this level:,"['T12-L1', 'L1-L2', 'L3-L4', 'L5-S1']","To determine the correct level for spinal anesthesia in an adult, it's important to understand the anatomy and the intended effect of spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is a regional anesthetic technique that involves injecting anesthetic medication into the subarachnoid space of the spinal canal to block sensation in a specific region. The level at which the anesthetic is administered depends on the desired area of anesthesia and the level of motor function preservation.

For most lower abdominal, lower limb, and perineal surgeries, the common level for spinal anesthesia is around T12-L1. This level allows for sufficient anesthesia in the lower body while preserving upper body motor function, which is crucial for patient safety.

- T12-L1: This is the most commonly used level for spinal anesthesia in adults, as it provides good coverage for lower abdominal, lower limb, and perineal surgeries.
- L1-L2: This level would provide less coverage for the lower limbs and might not be sufficient for surgeries requiring a broader area of anesthesia.
- L3-L4: This level is deeper and would provide more extensive anesthesia, which is not necessary for most lower abdominal and lower limb surgeries.
- L5-S1: This level is even deeper and would provide extensive anesthesia and motor blockage, which is not typical for most spinal anesthesia procedures.

Azathioprine (option B) is a well-established immunosuppressant used in the management of IBD. It works by inhibiting purine synthesis, which reduces the immune response. This medication has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission and reducing the need for corticosteroids.

Methotrexate (option A) can also be used in IBD, but it is more commonly used for perianal disease or when other treatments have failed. Cyclosporine (option C) and cyclophosphamide (option D) are potent immunosuppressants but are generally reserved for more severe cases and are associated with more significant side effects.

A. Increased biliary secretion of cholesterol: This is a known mechanism for lithogenic bile. When the body produces more cholesterol than can be excreted in the bile, it can lead to the formation of cholesterol stones.

B. Increased activity of HMG CoA reductase: This enzyme is involved in the production of cholesterol. Increased activity can lead to higher cholesterol levels, which can contribute to lithogenic bile. However, this is more directly related to cholesterol synthesis rather than biliary secretion.

C. Clofibrate: This is a fibrate drug that is used to lower triglycerides and raise HDL cholesterol. It does not directly contribute to the formation of lithogenic bile.

D. Low calorie and cholesterol rich diet: While a low calorie diet might contribute to weight loss and potentially lower cholesterol, a cholesterol rich diet would increase the likelihood of lithogenic bile and stone formation.

Based on the analysis, the most relevant mechanisms in the formation of lithogenic bile are increased biliary secretion of cholesterol (A) and increased activity of HMG CoA reductase (B).

1664,In embalmingr solution is given through ?,"['Veins', 'Aeries', 'Lymphatics', 'none of above']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options in the context of embalming practices. Embalming involves the process of preserving a body by treating it with chemicals to inhibit decomposition. In this process, the embalming fluid is introduced into the body through specific vessels or systems.

- **Veins (A)**: Veins are blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood from various parts of the body back to the heart. In embalming, the fluid is typically injected into the veins because the body's circulatory system helps distribute the fluid throughout the entire body.
- **Aeries (B)**: Aeries is not a standard term in the context of human anatomy. It is likely a misspelling of ""arteries,"" which are blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the body. However, embalming fluids are not typically introduced through arteries.
- **Lymphatics (C)**: Lymphatics are part of the lymphatic system, which is involved in the immune response and the transport of lymph. While the lymphatic system does transport substances throughout the body, it is not the primary route for embalming fluids.
- **None of the above (D)**: This option suggests that none of the listed options are correct. Given the common practice of using the circulatory system to distribute embalming fluid, this option seems less likely.

The most appropriate and common method for introducing embalming fluid into the body is through the veins, as the circulatory system helps distribute the fluid evenly.

1681,After postmoem body is handed over to :,"['The authority who has conducted inquest in that paicular case', 'Police station near by', 'Coroner', 'Chief magistrate']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. The term ""postmortem"" refers to the examination of a body after death. After this examination, the body must be handled according to the legal and administrative processes involved in the death.

2. An inquest is an official investigation into the circumstances of a death, particularly when it is sudden, unexplained, or violent. The person conducting the inquest would have the authority to determine the final disposition of the body.

3. A coroner is a medical official who performs postmortem examinations and investigates deaths to determine the cause and circumstances of a person's death. They would also be responsible for the handling of the body post-inquest.

4. A police station near by, or a chief magistrate, are not typically involved in the direct handling of bodies postmortem. Their roles are more related to the investigation and legal processes leading up to the inquest, rather than the physical handling of the body after the examination.

Based on these points, the most logical answer is that the body is handed over to the authority who has conducted the inquest, which would typically be the coroner.

  - Characterized by intraepidermal blisters due to autoantibodies against desmoglein proteins, leading to acantholysis (premature separation of epidermal cells).
  - This matches the clinical and histopathological findings provided.

- **Dermatitis herpetiformis (D)**:
  - Characterized by intensely itchy skin with blisters and papules.
  - Associated with gluten sensitivity and deposits of IgA in the skin, not acantholysis.

Given the intraepidermal blister and the presence of acantholytic cells, the diagnosis aligns with Pemphigus vulgaris.

1691,Widened anion gap is caused by all EXCEPT :,"['Lactic acidosis', 'Diarrhea', 'Diabetic keto-acidosis', 'Methanol poisoning']","To determine which condition does not cause a widened anion gap, let's consider each option:

A. Lactic acidosis: This condition is characterized by the accumulation of lactate, leading to an increase in the anion gap. Therefore, it does cause a widened anion gap.

B. Diarrhea: Diarrhea can lead to the loss of bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) in the stool, which is an important buffering agent. This results in metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap.

C. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): In DKA, the body produces excess ketones, which contribute to an elevated anion gap.

D. Methanol poisoning: Methanol is metabolized to formic acid, which can cause metabolic acidosis but does not directly contribute to an elevation in the anion gap like lactate or ketones do.

Based on the above reasoning, methanol poisoning does not cause a widened anion gap directly through the same mechanisms as the other options.

a) **Radial nerve injury cause anaesthesia over anatomical snuff box** - This is true. The radial nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the wrist and hand, and injury can cause anesthesia over the anatomical snuff box (the area on the back of the hand near the thumb).

b) **Median nerve injury cause wrist drop** - This is false. Wrist drop is typically caused by a radial nerve injury, not a median nerve injury. The median nerve does not innervate the muscles that extend the wrist.

c) **Ulnar nerve injury cause claw hand** - This is true. The ulnar nerve innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand, and its injury can lead to a claw hand deformity due to the weakness of these muscles.

d) **Index finger anesthesia is caused by median nerve injury** - This is true. The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the thumb, index, and middle fingers.

e) **Thumb anaesthesia is caused by ulnar nerve injury** - This is false. The thumb is primarily innervated by the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve.

Based on this analysis, the correct statements are a, c, and d.

1693,Neostigmine antagonizes non depolarising blockade by all of the following mechanism except,"['Decreasing the breakdown of acetyl choline at the motor end plate', 'Preventing the K+efflux', 'Increasing the release of acetyl choline at the motor end plate', 'Depolarization at the motor end plate']","Let's analyze each option in the context of how neostigmine interacts with non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA):

A. Decreasing the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) at the motor end plate: Neostigmine works by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which normally breaks down ACh. By inhibiting this enzyme, neostigmine increases the amount of ACh available at the motor end plate, thus countering the effects of non-depolarizing NMBA.

B. Preventing the K+ efflux: Neostigmine does not directly prevent potassium efflux from muscle cells. Instead, it acts on cholinergic receptors.

C. Increasing the release of acetylcholine at the motor end plate: Neostigmine can indirectly increase the release of ACh by stimulating cholinergic neurons, but its primary mechanism is to inhibit the breakdown of ACh, thus keeping more ACh available at the motor end plate.

D. Depolarization at the motor end plate: Neostigmine does not cause depolarization of the motor end plate directly. Its action is more about prolonging the effect of ACh on the receptors.

Considering the mechanisms of action, the option that is not a primary mechanism by which neostigmine antagonizes non-depolarizing blockade is B. Preventing the K+ efflux.

2. These categories have a natural order: from less satisfied to more satisfied.
3. The categories do not represent a numerical value, but they do indicate a sequence or ranking.

Now, let's consider each option:

A. Interval data: This type of data is measured along a scale where there is a consistent interval between points but no true zero. Examples include temperature in Celsius. This does not fit our scenario because the categories ""satisfied,"" ""very satisfied,"" and ""dissatisfied"" do not have consistent intervals.

B. Ratio data: This type of data has all the properties of interval data plus a true zero point, indicating the absence of the quantity. Examples include weight or height. The categories here do not have a true zero, and they do not represent a ratio.

C. Nominal data: This type of data involves categories or labels with no inherent order. Examples include gender, race, or type of car. In this case, the categories ""satisfied,"" ""very satisfied,"" and ""dissatisfied"" do have an order, so this is not correct.

D. Ordinal data: This type of data involves categories that have a natural, meaningful order. Examples include satisfaction levels or educational levels. This fits our scenario perfectly because the categories ""satisfied,"" ""very satisfied,"" and ""dissatisfied"" are ordered from least to most satisfied.

1704,A 65yr old male with his of Diabetes and HTN presents Ito OPD with complaints of diplopia and squint on examination secondary detion is seen to be more than primary detion Which of the following is the most probable diagnosis,"['Paralytic squint', 'Incomitant squint', 'Restrictive squint', 'Pseudo squint']","To determine the most probable diagnosis, let's analyze the given information:

- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension.
- The patient presents with complaints of diplopia and squint.
- The secondary deviation is seen to be more than the primary deviation.

In ophthalmology, a squint (strabismus) is defined by the misalignment of the eyes. There are different types of squint based on the nature of the deviation:

- **Paralytic squint**: This occurs when there is weakness of an eye muscle, leading to a deviation that is more pronounced in certain directions or when looking at specific angles.
- **Incomitant squint**: This is a squint where the amount of deviation varies depending on the direction of gaze.
- **Restrictive squint**: This is due to a restriction in the movement of an eye muscle, often due to a mass or scar tissue.
- **Pseudo squint**: This is a condition where the eyes appear to be misaligned due to asymmetry in the head or face, but the eye muscles themselves are functioning normally.

Given the patient's history of diabetes and hypertension, and the fact that the secondary deviation is more pronounced than the primary deviation, it suggests that the deviation is not constant and changes with gaze direction. This is a characteristic of **incomitant squint**.

1. **Thrombosis**: This is a condition where blood clots form in blood vessels. In the context of TTTS, the recipient twin can develop complications such as pulmonary hypertension and may have increased risk of thrombosis due to the high-output cardiac state.

2. **Hypovolemia**: This refers to a condition where the body has an abnormally low volume of blood. The donor twin, not the recipient, typically has hypovolemia because the recipient twin is receiving more blood than it is producing. However, the recipient twin can develop hypervolemia (too much blood) and associated complications.

3. **Kernicterus**: This is a condition caused by severe jaundice leading to brain damage. It is primarily associated with hyperbilirubinemia and is more commonly seen in infants with hemolytic disease, not typically a result of TTTS.

4. **Heart Failure**: The recipient twin can develop heart failure due to the high volume of blood and increased pressure on the heart.

A. **Aortic regurgitation**: This condition primarily affects the left ventricle and causes a backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. It typically does not directly influence the relationship between PAWP and LVEDP.

B. **Constrictive pericarditis**: This condition involves a thickened and inflamed pericardium that restricts the normal filling of the heart chambers. It can lead to increased filling pressures and can result in a significant gradient between PAWP and LVEDP due to the restriction in ventricular filling.

C. **Left atrial myxoma**: This is a benign tumor of the left atrium. While it can obstruct the flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle, it does not typically cause a significant gradient between PAWP and LVEDP.

D. **Pulmonary thromboembolism**: This condition involves a blockage in the pulmonary arteries, which can increase PAWP but does not typically cause a significant gradient between PAWP and LVEDP unless there are severe complications that affect left ventricular function.

Given the options, the most likely condition that would result in a gradient between PAWP and LVEDP is constrictive pericarditis, as it restricts the normal filling of the ventricles and can lead to elevated filling pressures.

They are directly involved in regulating metabolism and are often used to evaluate thyroid function, but their levels can be influenced by various factors and may not always reflect the full picture of thyroid function.

- **TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone)** is produced by the pituitary gland and regulates the production of T3 and T4 by the thyroid. Elevated TSH typically indicates hypothyroidism, while low TSH suggests hyperthyroidism. TSH is a more specific and sensitive marker for diagnosing thyroid disorders compared to T3 and T4.

- **Thyroglobulin** is a protein synthesized by the thyroid gland and is used primarily in monitoring thyroid cancer and assessing residual thyroid tissue post-surgery. It is not a primary diagnostic marker for general thyroid disorders.

Given these considerations, the best marker to diagnose a thyroid-related disorder is TSH, as it provides a direct indication of thyroid function and is a reliable indicator of thyroid disorders.

1718,"A young patient presented with sudden painless loss of vision with systolic murmur over chest, ocular examination reveals - cherry red spot in macula with clear AC, with perception of light, diagnosis:","['Central retinal aery occlusion', 'Central retinal vein occlusion', 'Macular choroiditis with infective endocarditis', 'Central serous retinopathy']","To reason through this question, let's break down the key information provided:

1. **Sudden painless loss of vision**: This is a critical symptom indicating a sudden onset of visual impairment.
2. **Systolic murmur over chest**: This suggests a cardiac issue, possibly related to infective endocarditis.
3. **Cherry red spot in macula**: This is a specific sign often associated with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). It results from a blockage in the central retinal artery, leading to ischemia in the macula.
4. **Clear anterior chamber (AC)**: This indicates that there is no obvious anterior segment inflammation.
5. **Perception of light**: This suggests that the photoreceptors in the retina are still functional, which is consistent with CRAO where the central retinal artery is blocked but not the retinal veins.

Given these symptoms and signs, the most likely diagnosis is:

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).

1719,Most common site of intracranial hemorrhage in hepertensive hemorrhage is -,"['Basal ganglia', 'Brainstem', 'Cerebellum', 'Hippocampus']","To determine the most common site of intracranial hemorrhage in hypertensive hemorrhage, it's important to consider the effects of hypertension on the brain. Hypertension can lead to small vessel disease, often resulting in hemorrhages in areas with the highest density of these small vessels. The basal ganglia are rich in small penetrating arteries that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of hypertension. This makes the basal ganglia a common site for hypertensive hemorrhages.

The brainstem and cerebellum are also potential sites for hemorrhages, but they are less common. The hippocampus is not typically a primary site for hypertensive hemorrhage due to its location and the distribution of blood vessels.

Therefore, the most common site of intracranial hemorrhage in hypertensive hemorrhage is the basal ganglia.

1727,Dogs are responsible for transmission of all the following except-,"['Hydatid disease', 'Toxoplasmosis', 'Kala-azar', 'Toxocara canis']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in terms of its transmission route and the role of dogs in disease transmission:

A. Hydatid disease - This is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, which is a tapeworm. Dogs can be definitive hosts, shedding eggs in their feces, which can lead to infection in other animals and humans, particularly when these eggs are ingested. However, dogs do not directly transmit the disease through their bite or contact.

B. Toxoplasmosis - This is caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Cats, not dogs, are the primary definitive hosts, and the parasite is often transmitted to humans and other animals through ingestion of contaminated food or water, or via contact with cat feces. However, dogs can become infected and can shed the parasite, though they are not the primary source of transmission.

C. Kala-azar - This is a disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania donovani, which is transmitted by the bite of infected female Phlebotomine sandflies. Dogs can be infected but are not vectors for human transmission. They can develop the disease but do not play a significant role in its spread.

D. Toxocara canis - This is a parasitic roundworm that infects the intestines of dogs and can also infect humans, particularly children. Dogs are the definitive host, and humans can become infected by ingesting infective eggs found in soil or other contaminated areas. Dogs directly transmit the parasite through their feces.

Given this analysis, the disease that is not primarily transmitted by dogs, and for which dogs are not the definitive host, is Kala-azar.

1747,"After overnight fasting, levels of glucose transpoers reduced in","['Brain cells', 'RBCs', 'Adipocytes', 'Hepatocytes']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the role of glucose transporters in different cell types under fasting conditions.

- **Brain cells (A)**: The brain primarily relies on glucose as a fuel source, and the expression of glucose transporters in the brain does not typically change significantly with fasting. Brain cells have a continuous requirement for glucose and maintain a constant level of glucose transporters.
  
- **Red Blood Cells (B)**: Red blood cells (RBCs) rely on glucose for energy and do not have insulin-dependent glucose transporters. They have a constant supply of glucose and the expression of glucose transporters in RBCs is not influenced by fasting.
  
- **Adipocytes (C)**: Adipocytes (fat cells) have glucose transporters, particularly GLUT4, which are primarily involved in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. During fasting, insulin levels drop, leading to reduced glucose uptake and thus reduced expression of GLUT4 in adipocytes.
  
- **Hepatocytes (D)**: Hepatocytes (liver cells) have glucose transporters, but their expression and function are not significantly altered by fasting. The liver plays a key role in glucose metabolism, but the expression of glucose transporters is not notably reduced during fasting.

Given the information, the correct answer is that glucose transporters are reduced in adipocytes during fasting.

A. **Serum iron levels** - While serum iron levels are useful, they can be misleading because they can be normal even in the presence of iron deficiency, especially if the body has stored some iron. They are also affected by recent iron intake.

B. **Serum ferritin levels** - Serum ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and is stored in the liver, bone marrow, and spleen. Low ferritin levels are highly specific for iron deficiency anemia, as ferritin is the primary storage form of iron in the body. However, ferritin can also be low in other conditions like inflammation or infection, which can affect its specificity.

C. **Serum transferrin receptor population** - The serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels are elevated during iron deficiency because the body tries to increase iron uptake. sTfR is highly sensitive to iron deficiency and has a high negative predictive value, meaning if sTfR is normal, iron deficiency can be ruled out. However, it is not as specific as serum ferritin in differentiating between iron deficiency and other conditions.

D. **Transferrin saturation** - This measures the percentage of transferrin saturation with iron. It is useful but not as sensitive as serum ferritin in diagnosing iron deficiency, especially in early stages.

Considering the sensitivity and specificity, **serum ferritin levels** are the most reliable marker for diagnosing iron deficiency because they are highly specific and can accurately reflect the body's iron stores.

1804,Which of the following is not a second messenger,"['c-AMP', 'IP3', 'Guanylyl cyclase', 'Diacylglycerol (DAG']","To determine which option is not a second messenger, let's first understand what a second messenger is. Second messengers are molecules that relay a signal from a receptor on the surface of a cell to other molecules inside the cell, leading to a cellular response. Common examples include cyclic AMP (c-AMP), inositol trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), and calcium ions (Ca2+).

Now, let's analyze each option:
- A. c-AMP: This is a well-known second messenger that helps relay signals from hormones like adrenaline.
- B. IP3: This is also a second messenger that triggers the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores.
- C. Guanylyl cyclase: This is actually an enzyme that produces a second messenger, cyclic GMP (cGMP), by catalyzing the formation of GMP from GTP. It is not a second messenger itself.
- D. Diacylglycerol (DAG): This is a second messenger that plays a role in intracellular signal transduction.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is the one that is not a second messenger but rather an enzyme involved in producing a second messenger.

In which one of the following perineural invasion is most commonly seen?,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma', 'Basal Cell Adenoma', 'Squamous cell carcinoma']","Perineural invasion (PNI) is a phenomenon where tumor cells invade along the perineural spaces, potentially allowing cancer cells to spread along nerves. It is particularly associated with specific types of tumors due to the biology and behavior of these cancers.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is known for its characteristic perineural invasion, which is a hallmark of the disease. This is because ACC has a predilection for growing in and along nerves, making PNI a common feature. ACC often affects the salivary glands, but it can occur in other locations such as the respiratory tract, breast, and other sites.

Adenocarcinoma, while it can occur in various forms and locations, is not specifically known for perineural invasion as a defining feature. Basal cell adenoma is benign and does not typically exhibit perineural invasion. Squamous cell carcinoma, while it can occur in various sites, does not have perineural invasion as a defining characteristic like ACC does.

Therefore, the most commonly associated type of perineural invasion is seen in adenoid cystic carcinoma.

1835,True regarding febrile convulsion –,"['Carbamazepine is good drug to treat it', 'Patient with family h/o F.C. have increased incidence of recurrence', 'Longterm neurological deficits are common', 'Usually last for short while']","Let's analyze each option:

A. Carbamazepine is good drug to treat it - Febrile convulsions are typically self-limiting and do not require specific anticonvulsant therapy like carbamazepine. Treatment is usually supportive and focused on fever control. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

B. Patient with family h/o F.C. have increased incidence of recurrence - Febrile convulsions have a genetic predisposition, and children with a family history of febrile convulsions are indeed at higher risk for recurrence. This statement is correct.

C. Longterm neurological deficits are common - Febrile convulsions are generally not associated with long-term neurological deficits. Most children recover fully with no lasting effects. This statement is incorrect.

D. Usually last for short while - Febrile convulsions typically last from a few seconds to a few minutes and usually do not last long. This statement is correct.

1836,Uterine-cervix ratio up to 10 years of age:,"['3:02', '2:01', '3:01', '1:02']","To determine the correct uterine-cervix ratio for a child up to 10 years of age, we need to consider the typical growth and development of the female reproductive system during childhood. In young girls, before puberty, the uterus is relatively small compared to the cervix. The ratio of uterus to cervix in prepubertal girls is typically around 1:2, meaning the cervix is twice the size of the uterus.

Let's review the options provided:
A. 3:02 - This suggests the cervix is smaller than the uterus, which is not typical for prepubertal girls.
B. 2:01 - This indicates the cervix is twice the size of the uterus, which aligns with the typical ratio.
C. 3:01 - This ratio suggests the uterus is larger than the cervix, which is not characteristic of prepubertal girls.
D. 1:02 - This would imply the cervix is even larger than in option B, which is not typical for this age group.

Given these considerations, the correct uterine-cervix ratio for a child up to 10 years of age is 2:01.

1838,Apparent volume of distribution (aVd) is more than total body fluid if drug is:,"['Poorly soluble', 'Sequestered in tissues', 'Slow elimination', 'Poorly plasma protein bound']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of the apparent volume of distribution (aVd):

A. Poorly soluble: This refers to the drug's solubility in water, which doesn't directly affect the aVd. The aVd is more about the distribution of the drug in the body, not its solubility.

B. Sequestered in tissues: If a drug is sequestered in tissues, it means that the drug is not freely circulating in the blood but is stored in other parts of the body. This would lead to a higher apparent volume of distribution because the drug appears to be more spread out throughout the body than it actually is in the plasma.

C. Slow elimination: Slow elimination affects the half-life and clearance of the drug but does not directly impact the apparent volume of distribution.

D. Poorly plasma protein bound: A drug that is poorly bound to plasma proteins will have a larger volume of distribution because it will remain in the plasma in a free form, giving the impression that it is more widely distributed.

Among these, the option that most directly affects the apparent volume of distribution is when a drug is sequestered in tissues, leading to a higher apparent volume.

1839,Deleterious effect of ultrasound on small organism is:,"['Ionisation', 'Vacoulation', 'Cavitation', 'Disintegration']","To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the effects of ultrasound on small organisms. Ultrasound involves the use of high-frequency sound waves to produce images or to treat tissues. When ultrasound is applied, it can cause various physical effects on biological tissues, including thermal and mechanical effects.

- **Ionisation**: This is a process where atoms or molecules gain or lose electrons, becoming electrically charged. Ultrasound does not cause ionisation directly, as it does not involve ionizing radiation.

- **Vacuolation**: This term refers to the formation of vacuoles, which are fluid-filled spaces within cells. While ultrasound can cause changes in cell structure, vacuolation is not a direct effect of ultrasound.

- **Cavitation**: This is the formation of vapor-filled cavities in a liquid under conditions of reduced pressure, which can occur when high-intensity ultrasound is applied. Cavitation can cause mechanical damage to cells and tissues, including small organisms.

- **Disintegration**: This implies breaking down into smaller parts. While ultrasound can cause cellular damage, it does not specifically refer to the disintegration of small organisms.

Given these explanations, the most accurate effect of ultrasound on small organisms is cavitation, as it describes the physical and mechanical damage caused by the ultrasound waves.

1842,Mechanism of action of vincristine in the treatment of ALL is:,"['Inhibition of topoisomerase II to cause breaks in DNA strands', 'Alkylation and cross linking DNA strands', 'Inhibition of DNA mediated RNA synthesis', 'Inhibition of polymerization of tubulin to form microtubules']","Vincristine is a plant alkaloid that works by inhibiting the polymerization of tubulin, which is a key protein involved in the formation of microtubules. Microtubules are important for cell division, and by preventing their formation, vincristine disrupts the process of mitosis, which is crucial for the rapid division of cancer cells, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Let's review the other options:
- Option A refers to topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as etoposide, which is a different class of drugs.
- Option B describes alkylating agents, which work by damaging DNA and are a different class of chemotherapeutic agents.
- Option C pertains to inhibitors of RNA synthesis, which is not the mechanism of vincristine.

1843,Blood for acid base gas (ABGO analysis in a bottle containing heparin can cause decreased value of -,"['pCO2', 'HCO2', 'pH', 'pO2']","Heparin, an anticoagulant, can affect the results of ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) analysis. However, the primary effect of heparin on ABG results is to prevent clotting, which is not directly related to the decreased values in any of the options given. The most significant impact of heparin in this context is on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Heparin can cause a temporary increase in pCO2 by reducing the rate of CO2 diffusion across the blood-gas membrane due to its effect on blood viscosity and flow. This effect is transient and usually not significant enough to cause a clinically detectable decrease in pCO2.

However, the question asks for the value that would be decreased, and based on the options provided, the most relevant impact of heparin on ABG analysis is not listed directly. Given the options, the effect of heparin is most likely not to decrease pCO2 but to potentially affect other parameters indirectly. Among the options provided, the one that is least likely to be directly affected by heparin is pO2, though it could be affected indirectly. Heparin is more likely to impact pCO2 and pH, but the question specifically asks for a decrease.

Gangliosides are a type of glycolipid that are primarily found in the nervous system, particularly in neural tissues. They are characterized by the presence of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, NANA), a carbohydrate component, and a lipid component, which usually includes a long chain fatty acid and a sphingosine.

Now, let's analyze each option:

A. NANA, hexose, fatty acid, glycerol - Glycerol is not part of the structure of gangliosides; they are typically found in sphingolipids, not glycolipids.

B. NANA, hexose, fatty acid, phosphorycholine - Phosphorycholine is not a component of gangliosides.

C. NANA, sphingosine, ethanolamine - Ethanolamine is not a component of gangliosides; gangliosides typically contain sphingosine as their long-chain base and NANA as the sialic acid.

D. NANA, hexose, sphingosine, long chain fatty acid - This option correctly includes the components that make up gangliosides: NANA (as a component of the carbohydrate portion), sphingosine (as the long-chain base), and a long chain fatty acid (as the lipid component).

A. Scleroderma: This is an autoimmune disease characterized by hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues due to excessive collagen deposits. It can affect the gastrointestinal tract, leading to esophageal dysmotility and often causing a beak-like narrowing at the lower esophageal sphincter, not uniform dilation.

B. Trypanosoma cruzi infection: This parasite causes Chagas disease, which can affect the heart and digestive system. In the gastrointestinal tract, it can lead to megacolon and megaesophagus, which involves dilation, but it is not typically uniform.

C. Dermatomyositis: This is an inflammatory disease of the muscles and skin. It can affect the esophagus, but it generally causes motility disorders and strictures, not uniform dilation.

1848,A 70 year old man develops pneumonia and septicemia. Patient goes into renal failure and has a BP of 70/50 mm of Hg. Drug that should be used to maintain BP is:,"['Adrenaline', 'Ephedrine', 'Phenylephrine', 'Nor epinephrine']","To determine the correct drug to maintain blood pressure in this scenario, we need to consider the patient's condition and the pharmacological properties of the options provided.

- **Adrenaline (Epinephrine)**: This drug causes significant vasoconstriction and an increase in heart rate. While it can raise blood pressure, it can also cause tachycardia and potentially lead to arrhythmias. It's generally not the first choice for hypotension in septic shock due to its cardiac effects.
  
- **Ephedrine**: This drug primarily causes vasodilation initially, followed by vasoconstriction. It can be used in hypotension but has less predictable effects and can cause tachycardia and hypertension.
  
- **Phenylephrine**: This drug is a selective alpha-1 agonist, which means it causes strong vasoconstriction with minimal effect on the heart rate. This makes it a good option for treating hypotension in septic shock as it can raise blood pressure without significantly affecting the heart rate.
  
- **Nor epinephrine (Norepinephrine)**: This is a potent alpha-1 agonist with some beta-1 agonist properties. It causes strong vasoconstriction and can raise blood pressure, but it can also increase heart rate and can be associated with arrhythmias, making it less ideal for the first-line treatment of septic shock.

Given that the patient is in septic shock and has renal failure, the goal is to maintain blood pressure without causing excessive cardiac burden or arrhythmias. Phenylephrine is a good choice because it primarily targets vasoconstriction without significantly affecting the heart rate.

1850,Greater than 30 g of fat is excreted in feces per day. The cause is,"['Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Rapid transient diarrhea', 'Small intesitnal disease', 'Normal']","Let's analyze each option:

A. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: This condition occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes. Without these enzymes, fats in the diet cannot be properly broken down, leading to fat malabsorption and consequently, an increased amount of fat in the feces.

B. Rapid transient diarrhea: This is a type of diarrhea that is often associated with viral or bacterial infections and does not typically lead to significant fat malabsorption unless it is severe or prolonged.

C. Small intestinal disease: While diseases of the small intestine can lead to malabsorption, they generally do not cause such a specific or dramatic increase in fat excretion as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency does.

D. Normal: Normal fecal fat excretion is typically less than 7 g per day, so more than 30 g is not considered normal.

Given the context of the question, the most likely cause of greater than 30 g of fat excreted in feces per day is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

Nursing bottle syndrome, also known as baby bottle tooth decay, results from prolonged exposure of the teeth to sugary liquids, leading to severe tooth decay. The primary consequences of this condition include:

1. **Speech and Esthetics**: While speech and appearance are important, they are not the primary functional concerns in early childhood.
2. **Form and Function**: The primary concern with tooth decay is how it affects the child's ability to eat and speak properly. Decayed teeth can impair proper chewing (mastication) and could also affect speech development.
3. **Incising and Mastication**: Incising refers to the cutting action of the teeth, which is crucial for proper chewing. Mastication (chewing) is essential for digestion and overall nutrition. Replacing teeth destroyed due to nursing bottle syndrome primarily aims to restore the ability to chew and eat properly.
4. **Arch Perimeter Requirements in the Transitional Dentition**: This option is more relevant to the space management in the oral cavity during the transitional dentition phase, but it is not the primary reason for replacing teeth destroyed due to nursing bottle syndrome.

Considering the primary functional impacts of tooth decay in early childhood, the most appropriate answer is related to the ability to chew and eat properly.

The abdominal pain is mediated by afferent fibers that travel initially with which of the following nerves?","['Greater thoracic splanchnic', 'Intercostal', 'Phrenic', 'Vagus']","To determine which nerve mediates the afferent fibers for abdominal pain from the head of the pancreas, we need to consider the anatomy and innervation of this region.

The head of the pancreas is located retroperitoneally and is innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. For afferent (sensory) fibers, the main nerve involved in abdominal pain is the vagus nerve (Cranial Nerve X). The vagus nerve provides sensory innervation to the upper abdominal region, including the pancreas.

The other options are not primarily involved in abdominal pain:
- The greater thoracic splanchnic nerves (A) are involved in sympathetic innervation and are more relevant to visceral motor functions.
- The intercostal nerves (B) are involved in thoracic and abdominal wall sensation but not primarily in visceral sensation.
- The phrenic nerve (C) is involved in innervating the diaphragm and not typically in abdominal pain.

Thus, the afferent fibers for the dull, diffuse abdominal pain from the head of the pancreas are primarily mediated by the vagus nerve.

1854,Advantage of Minimal access surgery,"['Heat loss', 'Better Hemostasis control', 'Improved vision', 'In wound pain']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of minimal access surgery (MAS), also known as minimally invasive surgery (MIS).

A. Heat loss: Minimal access surgery does not inherently reduce heat loss. This is more related to energy conservation or thermal management in different contexts, not a primary benefit of MAS.

B. Better Hemostasis control: MAS can provide better hemostasis (control of bleeding) because smaller incisions and less tissue damage can lead to less bleeding. This is a significant advantage, especially in procedures where bleeding is a concern.

C. Improved vision: Improved vision is more relevant to endoscopic procedures, which are a subset of MAS, but it is not a general advantage of minimal access surgery. Better visualization is a benefit of certain types of minimally invasive procedures, but it is not a universal advantage.

D. In wound pain: While reduced scarring and smaller incisions can lead to less post-operative pain, this is not the most significant or universal advantage of minimal access surgery. Pain reduction is a benefit but not the primary advantage.

Considering the primary advantages of minimal access surgery, the most accurate answer is B. Better Hemostasis control.

The patient has had repeated infections with both Candida albicans and respiratory viruses. This suggests a compromised immune system. 

1. **Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)**: This vaccine is used to prevent tuberculosis. While it is live but attenuated, it is generally considered safe for immunocompetent individuals and those with normal immune systems. However, in immunocompromised individuals, there is a risk of disseminated BCG disease, which can be severe. This risk is particularly high in patients with chronic granulomatous disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, or other severe immunodeficiencies.

1876,Urination in the human subject is decreased by,"['Nicotinic agonists', 'AChase inhibitors', 'muscarinic agonists', 'muscarinic antagonists']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the function of the muscarinic receptors in the bladder. Muscarinic receptors are involved in the contraction of the bladder smooth muscle, leading to the process of urination. When these receptors are activated (by muscarinic agonists), the bladder contracts, resulting in increased urination. Conversely, when muscarinic receptors are inhibited (by muscarinic antagonists), the bladder's ability to contract is reduced, leading to decreased urination.

Nicotinic agonists, on the other hand, primarily affect the sympathetic nervous system and do not directly influence bladder function in a way that would decrease urination.

AChase inhibitors are not a standard medical term, so this option is not relevant to the question.

Given this information, muscarinic antagonists would be the correct answer as they would reduce the contraction of the bladder, leading to decreased urination.

1877,More resistance in respiration is due to which of the following?,"['Saturation with moisture', 'Increased rate of flow during expiration', 'Increased compression of airway', 'Due to change from linear to turbulent flow']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A. Saturation with moisture: While moisture in the air can affect respiration, it does not directly cause more resistance. The effect of moisture is more about humidifying the air rather than increasing resistance.

B. Increased rate of flow during expiration: An increased rate of flow can affect the resistance, but it is not the primary cause of increased resistance in respiration. Instead, it is more related to the dynamics of airflow.

C. Increased compression of airway: Compression of the airway can indeed increase resistance, but it is not the most common or primary cause of increased resistance in normal respiratory physiology.

D. Due to change from linear to turbulent flow: This is the correct answer. Turbulent flow, which occurs when the flow of air becomes chaotic and disordered, typically happens at higher velocities and can significantly increase airway resistance. This is a well-established principle in respiratory physiology.

1888,Apical root fracture in an anterior tooth is treated by:,"['Extraction', 'Splinting for 2-3 months', 'Endodontic treatment', 'All of the above']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. An apical root fracture in an anterior tooth is a specific type of dental injury where the root is broken close to the apex (tip) of the root.

2. Extraction (Option A):
   - Extraction is a treatment option when a tooth is severely damaged and cannot be saved.
   - It is not typically the first choice for managing an apical root fracture.

3. Splinting for 2-3 months (Option B):
   - Splinting is used to stabilize the tooth and prevent further movement after a fracture.
   - This can promote healing and may allow the tooth to be retained.
   - It is a common conservative treatment for apical root fractures.

4. Endodontic treatment (Option C):
   - Endodontic treatment (root canal therapy) is used to treat infections and save the tooth by cleaning and filling the root canals.
   - While this can be necessary for certain root fractures, it is not the primary treatment for an apical root fracture itself.

5. Considering all options:
   - Splinting is often the first step to manage the fracture.
   - Endodontic treatment may be needed if there is infection or if the tooth is non-vital.
   - Extraction is a last resort and not typically the first choice for an apical root fracture.

Given this reasoning, the most comprehensive and correct answer is that all of these treatments could be part of the management plan, with splinting being the immediate treatment and endodontic treatment being a possible subsequent step if needed.

A. Most neoplasms are subdural in origin - This is generally false. Neoplastic compressive myelopathy typically involves intradural-extramedullary tumors, which are more commonly spinal tumors that extend from the spinal cord into the subarachnoid space, not subdural.

B. Thoracic spine is most commonly involved - This is true. Neoplastic compressive myelopathy is indeed most commonly found in the thoracic region of the spine.

C. Tumor does not cross the disk space to involve adjacent vertebral body - This is true. Intradural-extramedullary tumors tend to stay within the subarachnoid space and do not cross the intervertebral disk space to affect the vertebral body directly.

D. Prognosis is poor when motor deficits are established for > 48 hours - This is true. Delayed intervention often results in a poor prognosis due to significant neurological damage.

A. Has somatotropic activity.
- Prolactin does not have somatotropic activity. Somatotropin (or growth hormone) is the hormone responsible for growth and metabolism, not prolactin.

B. It flow can cause infertility in women.
- While prolactin can affect fertility, ""flow"" is not a correct term in this context. High prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia) can indeed cause infertility in women by interfering with ovulation and menstrual cycles.

C. Can suppress menstrual cycle in lactating women.
- This is a correct statement. During lactation, prolactin levels are elevated, which can suppress the menstrual cycle in women as a natural contraceptive mechanism.

D. Levels are increased by dopamine.
- This statement is incorrect. Dopamine actually inhibits prolactin secretion. It does this through the dopaminergic pathway in the hypothalamus.

1894,"The patient is delivered by cesarean section under general anesthesia.The baby and placenta are easily delivered, but the uterus is noted to be boggy and atonic despite intravenous infusion of Pitocin. All of the following are appropriate agents to use next except","['Methylergonovine (Methergine) administered intramuscularly', 'Prostaglandin F2α (Hemabate) suppositories', 'Misoprostil (Cytotec) suppositories', 'Terbutaline administered intravenously']","Let's reason through the options given the context of the patient's condition. The patient had a cesarean section under general anesthesia, and despite the administration of Pitocin (oxytocin), the uterus remains boggy and atonic. This indicates that uterine atony is not responding to the initial treatment with oxytocin.

- **Option A (Methylergonovine (Methergine) administered intramuscularly)**: This is a strong uterotonic and can be used in cases of uterine atony. It is often used when other agents are not effective.

- **Option B (Prostaglandin F2α (Hemabate) suppositories)**: Prostaglandin F2α is another potent uterotonic that can be used for uterine atony. It is often used when other medications fail.

- **Option C (Misoprostil (Cytotec) suppositories)**: Misoprostol is also a uterotonic and can be used to manage uterine atony. It is often used in cases where other treatments are not effective.

- **Option D (Terbutaline administered intravenously)**: Terbutaline is a β2-adrenergic agonist, primarily used to treat bronchospasm, asthma, and other respiratory conditions. It does not have significant uterotonic properties and is not used for managing uterine atony.

Given that the primary goal is to manage uterine atony, options A, B, and C are appropriate agents to use. Option D is not appropriate for this condition.

1895,Left Kidney is preferred for transplantation because,"['Longer renal Vein', 'Higher location', 'Ease of surgery due to anatomical relations', 'To prevent damage to liver']","Let's reason through the options provided:

A. Longer renal Vein - While the length of the renal vein might play a role in some surgical considerations, it is not a primary reason for choosing the left kidney over the right for transplantation.

B. Higher location - The left kidney is actually lower in the abdominal cavity compared to the right kidney, so this option is incorrect.

C. Ease of surgery due to anatomical relations - The left kidney is often preferred for transplantation because it is more easily accessible due to the absence of the liver on the left side and its position lower in the body. This makes the surgical approach less complex and safer.

D. To prevent damage to liver - The liver is not on the left side of the body, so this option is not relevant to the anatomical considerations of kidney transplantation.

Given these considerations, the most accurate reason for preferring the left kidney for transplantation is due to ease of surgery due to anatomical relations.

1896,Liposomal amphotericin B has the following advantage over conventional amphotericin B:,"['Lesser nephrotoxicity', 'Lesser cost', 'Absense of infusional toxicity', 'Once a week administration']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of the advantages of liposomal amphotericin B over conventional amphotericin B:

A. Lesser nephrotoxicity: Conventional amphotericin B is known for its nephrotoxic effects, which can lead to kidney damage. Liposomal amphotericin B, by encapsulating the drug in liposomes, is designed to reduce this side effect. This makes it a significant advantage.

B. Lesser cost: While liposomal amphotericin B might be more expensive due to the technology used for its formulation, cost is not typically listed as an advantage when comparing these two forms of the drug.

C. Absence of infusional toxicity: Infusional toxicity refers to the side effects experienced during or immediately after the infusion of the drug. Conventional amphotericin B is notorious for causing chills, fever, nausea, and other reactions during administration. Liposomal amphotericin B is known to reduce these infusional reactions, making it a significant advantage.

D. Once a week administration: This is not a well-documented advantage of liposomal amphotericin B over conventional amphotericin B. The dosing frequency can vary based on the specific treatment regimen and the condition being treated.

Given the information, the most significant advantage of liposomal amphotericin B is its reduced infusional toxicity.

1898,Which of the following generations of amalgam exhibit highest nobility?,"['3rd generation amalgam', '4th generation amalgam', '5th generation amalgam', '6th generation amalgam']","To determine which generation of amalgam exhibits the highest nobility, we need to understand what ""nobility"" refers to in this context. In dental materials, the term ""nobility"" often refers to the alloy's resistance to corrosion and its biocompatibility. Generally, newer generations of amalgam have incorporated more noble (less reactive) metals to improve these properties.

1. First-generation amalgams primarily used silver-tin alloys, which were less noble and had higher rates of corrosion.
2. Second-generation amalgams improved by adding copper to increase strength and stability.
3. Third-generation amalgams introduced a higher content of silver and tin, further enhancing stability.
4. Fourth-generation amalgams further refined the alloy composition, increasing the proportion of noble metals like gold and palladium.
5. Fifth-generation amalgams continued to refine the composition, often reducing the amount of mercury and increasing the noble metal content even more.
6. Sixth-generation amalgams are the most recent and typically have the highest proportion of noble metals, aiming for better biocompatibility and reduced corrosion.

Given this progression, the sixth-generation amalgam would be expected to have the highest nobility due to its increased use of noble metals.

This presentation could be caused by all of following except:","['Parkinsonism', 'Major depression', 'Negative symptoms are still persisting', 'He is reacting to external stimuli']","Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient on neuroleptics for Schizophrenia is showing an improvement in psychotic symptoms but has developed sadness, talks less, and remains mostly in bed. These are symptoms that could be associated with different conditions or reactions.

A. Parkinsonism - Neuroleptics can cause extrapyramidal side effects, including Parkinsonism, characterized by rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. This does not directly match the described symptoms of sadness, reduced speech, and lack of activity.

B. Major depression - The patient's sadness, reduced speech, and lack of activity are classic symptoms of depression. Neuroleptics can induce or exacerbate depressive symptoms.

C. Negative symptoms are still persisting - Schizophrenia is characterized by both positive (psychotic) and negative symptoms (such as reduced speech, lack of motivation, and social withdrawal). The patient's symptoms align well with this description.

D. He is reacting to external stimuli - This option does not fit well because the symptoms described are internal mood and behavior changes rather than a reaction to external stimuli.

Given the analysis, the symptom presentation described is most likely due to major depression, negative symptoms persisting, or extrapyramidal side effects, but not necessarily a reaction to external stimuli.

1906,Drug used for Buerger's disease:,"['Xanthinol nicotinate', 'Propranolol', 'CCBs', 'All of the above']","Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a disorder of the blood vessels that primarily affects the arteries and veins of the legs and feet. It is characterized by inflammation and thrombosis, leading to obstruction of blood flow. Treatment options for Buerger's disease include smoking cessation, analgesics, and sometimes vasodilators to improve blood flow.

Xanthinol nicotinate is a vitamin B3 derivative with vasodilatory properties. It is commonly used in Europe to treat peripheral vascular disease and may be beneficial in Buerger's disease due to its ability to dilate blood vessels.

Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which can be used to relieve the symptoms of Buerger's disease such as pain and spasms, but it does not directly improve the blood flow.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are also used to improve blood flow in peripheral vascular disease, which could be beneficial in Buerger's disease as well.

1924,Cyanide affects respiratory chain by,"['Non-competitive reversible inhibition', 'Competitive reversible inhibition', 'Suicide irreversible inhibition', 'Non-competitive irreversible inhibition']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand how cyanide affects the respiratory chain. Cyanide binds to the iron of cytochrome c oxidase, which is part of Complex IV in the electron transport chain. This binding does not allow the complex to function properly, as it prevents the reduction of oxygen, leading to the inability to produce ATP. This binding is not reversible and is considered a form of irreversible inhibition. Additionally, since cyanide binds to the active site of cytochrome c oxidase, it does not fit the criteria for non-competitive inhibition but rather affects the active site directly, which aligns with ""suicide"" inhibition because it permanently inactivates the enzyme.

Surgeon leaves the layer of the tumour adherent with colliculus', 'First ventirculoperitoneal shunt was done', 'CCNU and vincristine were given as chemotherapy', 'Radiotherapy 35-40 Gy was given to the whole craniospinal axis']","Let's reason through the options provided:

- **Option A:** Craniotomy and sub-total excision of the tumour. Surgeon leaves the layer of the tumour adherent with colliculus.
  - This option suggests leaving a portion of the tumor adherent to the colliculus. While it is important to remove as much of the tumor as possible, leaving a portion behind can be considered irrational if it significantly reduces the likelihood of a cure or leads to recurrence.

- **Option B:** First ventriculoperitoneal shunt was done.
  - This option involves a surgical procedure to manage hydrocephalus by diverting cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles to the peritoneum. This is a standard and rational procedure to alleviate symptoms caused by the obstruction.

- **Option C:** CCNU and vincristine were given as chemotherapy.
  - These are standard chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of medulloblastoma. Administering these drugs is a rational approach to treating the cancer.

- **Option D:** Radiotherapy 35-40 Gy was given to the whole craniospinal axis.
  - This is a standard approach for treating medulloblastoma, especially in children, to target the primary tumor and potential disseminated disease. Given the high dose and wide area, it is a rational and standard treatment.

Given the context, leaving a portion of the tumor adherent to the colliculus (Option A) is the most likely irrational approach as it could compromise the effectiveness of the treatment.

1. **Patient Profile**: A 64-year-old hypertensive, obese female undergoing surgery for a fracture femur under general anesthesia.
2. **Clinical Presentation**: End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) decreased from 40 to 20 mm of Hg, followed by hypotension and oxygen saturation of 85%.

**Key Points to Consider**:
- A sudden drop in EtCO2 can indicate airway obstruction or hypoventilation.
- Hypotension and decreased oxygen saturation suggest poor perfusion or ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
- Fat embolism is a rare but serious complication of long bone fractures, typically presenting with a sudden drop in oxygen saturation and neurological changes.
- Hypovolemia can cause hypotension and decreased oxygen saturation but typically would not be associated with a sudden drop in EtCO2.
- Bronchospasm can cause hypoxemia and decreased oxygen saturation but would not typically cause a sudden drop in EtCO2.
- Myocardial infarction can cause hypotension and decreased oxygen saturation but would not typically cause a sudden drop in EtCO2.

- **Previous chemotherapy (B)**: While chemotherapy can have various effects on the body, including immunosuppression and systemic toxicity, it is generally not as directly implicated in the failure to close a surgical fistula as radiation therapy is.

- **Recent surgery (C)**: Recent surgery can cause inflammation and may complicate the healing process, but it is generally not as long-lasting an effect as radiation. The patient had surgery 10 days ago, which is not a particularly long time for the effects of radiation to fully manifest.

- **History of malignancy (D)**: The presence of a history of malignancy (rectal cancer) is not directly related to the healing of a surgical fistula. Although the malignancy itself and the treatments for it can affect the body, the specific factor we are looking for is more directly related to the current treatment and its impact on tissue healing.

Given these considerations, the factor most likely to prevent closure of the enterocutaneous fistula is the previous radiation therapy, which has a significant impact on tissue healing and blood supply.

1950,A 30 year old lady is to undergo surgery under intravenous regional anesthesia for her left 'trigger finger'. Which one of the following should not be used for patient?,"['Lignocaine', 'Bupivacaine', 'Prilocaine', 'Lignocaine + ketorolac.']","To determine which local anesthetic should not be used for intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) in this scenario, we need to consider the specific properties and commonly used agents for this technique.

IVRA is a type of regional anesthesia in which a local anesthetic is injected into a vein in the arm or hand. The anesthetic travels through the veins to the site of the nerve supplying the area of the body to be anesthetized. The local anesthetic should be lipid-soluble and have a rapid onset, as well as a short duration of action, to ensure effective block of the nerve without significant toxicity.

Let's review the options:

A. Lignocaine (Lidocaine) - This is a common choice for IVRA due to its rapid onset and short duration of action. It is lipid-soluble and suitable for this technique.

B. Bupivacaine - This is a long-acting local anesthetic with a slow onset and a longer duration of action. It is not typically used for IVRA due to the risk of systemic toxicity if it is not properly contained within the local venous system.

C. Prilocaine - This is another local anesthetic that is suitable for IVRA due to its rapid onset and short duration of action. It is lipid-soluble and effective for this technique.

D. Lignocaine + ketorolac - Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is sometimes added to local anesthetics to enhance their efficacy and reduce the dose of local anesthetic needed. While the combination is not commonly used for IVRA, there is no inherent reason it should be avoided if used appropriately.

Given these considerations, the local anesthetic that should not be used for IVRA is Bupivacaine because of its long duration of action and risk of systemic toxicity.

1953,Female sterilization is absolutely contraindicated in:,"['Hea disease', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Hypeension', 'None of the above']","To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the medical conditions listed and their relevance to female sterilization procedures. Female sterilization, also known as tubal ligation, is a surgical procedure to permanently close the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy.

- **Heart disease (A)**: While heart disease can be a serious condition, it is generally not an absolute contraindication to tubal ligation. The procedure itself does not directly affect the heart, and patients with stable heart conditions can often undergo the procedure safely with appropriate medical management.

- **Diabetes mellitus (B)**: Diabetes can affect wound healing and increase the risk of infections, but it is not an absolute contraindication to tubal ligation. Proper management of diabetes and perioperative care can mitigate these risks.

- **Hypertension (C)**: Hypertension, like diabetes, can affect wound healing and increase the risk of complications, but it is not an absolute contraindication to tubal ligation. Adequate blood pressure control and proper medical care can help manage these risks.

- **None of the above (D)**: Given the above considerations, none of the listed conditions (heart disease, diabetes, hypertension) are absolute contraindications to female sterilization.

Therefore, the correct answer is that none of the given conditions are absolute contraindications to female sterilization.

1978,A 67 yr male with history of chronic smoking hemoptysis with cough. Bronchoscopic biopsy from centrally located mass shows undifferentiated tumor histopathologically. Most useful I.H.C. (immunohistochemical) marker to make a proper diagnosis would be:,"['Cytokeratin', 'Parvalbumin', 'HMB-45', 'Hep-par1']","To determine the most useful immunohistochemical (IHC) marker for diagnosing an undifferentiated tumor, it's important to consider the characteristics of the tumor and the markers that can help differentiate it from other types of tumors.

- **Cytokeratin** is a general marker for epithelial cells and is commonly used in diagnosing carcinomas, but it does not specifically differentiate between different types of carcinomas.
- **Parvalbumin** is more specific and is typically used to identify neuronal and other specific types of cells, making it less likely to be the most useful marker in this context.
- **HMB-45** is a marker for melanoma, which is a type of undifferentiated tumor, but it is specific and would only be relevant if melanoma is suspected.
- **Hep-par1 ( Hepatocyte Paraffin-1)** is a marker used to identify hepatocellular carcinomas and some other liver-related tumors, but it is not typically the first choice for diagnosing undifferentiated tumors in other locations.

Given that the tumor is undifferentiated and centrally located, and considering the options provided, **Hep-par1 (Hepatocyte Paraffin-1)** is a commonly used marker in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinomas and can help in ruling out this type of cancer, which is a common undifferentiated tumor in the liver. However, without more specific information about the patient's liver function and other clinical details, it's important to note that this marker is not universally the best for all undifferentiated tumors, but it is one of the more specific options given.

1979,Type IV complex of ETC is inhibited by,"['Oligomycin', 'Antimycin', 'Cyanide', 'CO2']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the inhibition of different complexes in the electron transport chain (ETC). Type IV complex of the ETC refers to Complex IV, which is also known as cytochrome c oxidase. This enzyme is responsible for the reduction of oxygen to water and is the terminal oxidase in the respiratory chain.

- **Oligomycin** (Option A) inhibits Complex V (ATP synthase), which is responsible for the synthesis of ATP.
- **Antimycin** (Option B) is an inhibitor of Complex III, blocking the electron transfer from cytochrome b to cytochrome c1.
- **Cyanide** (Option C) and **CO2** (Option D) affect Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). Cyanide specifically binds to the iron-sulfur centers of cytochrome oxidase, thereby blocking the reduction of oxygen to water. CO2, on the other hand, is not a direct inhibitor of Complex IV.

Given that the question asks specifically about the inhibition of Complex IV, and considering the nature of cyanide as a direct inhibitor of this complex, the correct answer is:

1980,In recent surveillance reports cases of diphtheria are reducing. This is due to -,"['Chemoprophylaxis', 'Improved standard of living', 'Vaccination', 'Health education']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A. Chemoprophylaxis: This involves the use of antibiotics to prevent the spread of infection in close contacts of infected individuals. While it can help control outbreaks, it is not the primary method for reducing the incidence of diphtheria in a population over the long term.

B. Improved standard of living: While improving the standard of living can contribute to better health outcomes, it is not a specific measure targeted at preventing diphtheria. It is more of a general factor that could influence overall health but is not the direct cause of the reduction in cases.

C. Vaccination: Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. The widespread use of diphtheria toxoid vaccines has been the primary method for reducing the incidence of diphtheria in populations over time. Vaccination provides immunity to individuals and helps to create herd immunity, reducing the spread of the disease.

D. Health education: Educating people about the importance of hygiene and health can contribute to reducing the spread of various diseases, but it is not the primary method for preventing diphtheria. It supports vaccination efforts but does not directly cause the reduction in cases.

Considering the primary methods used to control and prevent diphtheria, the correct answer is C.

It does not simply count the number of babies born to a woman or just the girl babies, but rather takes into account the survival of these daughters to reproductive age.

Let's analyze each option:

A. Number of girl babies born to a woman - This is not entirely accurate because NRR considers the survival of these daughters to reproductive age.
B. Number of babies born to a woman - This is not accurate because NRR specifically considers only the female offspring and their survival to reproductive age.
C. Number of girl babies born to a woman and taking into account only alive once - This is closer but still not precise. NRR does consider the survival of these daughters to reproductive age, not just the fact that they are alive once.

1983,A case of injury to right brow due to a fall from scooter present with sudden loss of vision in the right eye.The pupil shows absent direct reflex but a normal consensual pupillary reflex is present. The fundus is normal. The treatment of choice is-,"['Intensive intravenous corticosteroids as prescribed for spinal injuries to be instituted within six hours', 'Pulse methyl Prednisolone 250 mg four times daily for three days', 'Oral Prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg body weight', 'Emergency optic canal decompression']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the scenario step by step:

1. **Injury to the Right Brow**: This suggests a potential trauma to the orbit and surrounding tissues.
2. **Sudden Loss of Vision in the Right Eye**: This is a critical finding and could indicate a serious condition affecting the optic nerve.
3. **Absent Direct Pupillary Reflex, Normal Consensual Reflex**: This indicates a lesion in the optic nerve itself, as the consensual reflex is mediated via the retinohypothalamic tract and would be preserved if the optic nerve is intact.
4. **Normal Fundus**: This suggests that the optic nerve head itself is not damaged, ruling out conditions such as optic neuritis or ischemic optic neuropathy.
5. **Emergency Context**: The patient presents with sudden vision loss, which is a medical emergency.

Given the above, the injury is likely to have caused compression or direct trauma to the optic nerve, possibly due to trauma to the orbit. This scenario is often indicative of an orbital blowout fracture or a direct optic nerve injury, leading to compression of the optic nerve within the optic canal.

**Treatment Options:**
- **A. Intensive intravenous corticosteroids**: While corticosteroids can be used to reduce inflammation, this is not the primary treatment for an acute optic nerve compression.
- **B. Pulse methyl Prednisolone 250 mg four times daily for three days**: This is a treatment for optic neuritis, which is not the primary condition here.
- **C. Oral Prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg body weight**: Similar to A, this is an anti-inflammatory measure and not the primary treatment for optic nerve compression.
- **D. Emergency optic canal decompression**: This is the most appropriate treatment for optic nerve compression due to trauma, as it aims to relieve pressure on the optic nerve and potentially preserve vision.

1984,Drug the choice for hyperthyroidism in first trimester of pregnancy is,"['Methimazole', 'Propylthiouraril', 'Carbimazole', 'Perchlorate']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the options available and their safety profiles during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester.

- **Methimazole**: This drug is commonly used for hyperthyroidism and is generally considered safe in the first trimester of pregnancy.
- **Propylthiouracil (PTU)**: PTU is another option for treating hyperthyroidism in pregnant women, but it is typically preferred over methimazole in the first trimester due to a slightly higher risk of fetal abnormalities associated with methimazole.
- **Carbimazole**: This is a prodrug that is converted to methimazole in the body. It is not commonly used as a first-line treatment during pregnancy because it is not as effective as methimazole or PTU, and its safety profile during pregnancy is less established.
- **Perchlorate**: This is not a medication used for treating hyperthyroidism; it is used to treat iodine deficiency disorders.

Given these considerations, the choice that is most commonly recommended and has a better safety profile during the first trimester is **Methimazole**.

A. Cell shrinkage: This is typically more characteristic of apoptosis. In necrosis, cells often swell or lyse, which does not fit this description.

B. Bleb formation: Blebs are small, rounded outpouchings of the cell membrane that can form during apoptosis. However, in necrosis, there is cell swelling and eventual rupture, so bleb formation is not a common feature.

C. Chromatin condensation: This is a hallmark of apoptosis, where the DNA within the cell nucleus becomes more compact and can be seen under a microscope. While necrosis can also show some changes in chromatin, it is not a common or defining feature.

D. Presence of inflammation: Necrosis often leads to the release of cellular contents that can trigger an inflammatory response. Apoptosis, on the other hand, generally does not cause an inflammatory response because the cell membrane remains intact.

Given these points, the common change in cell death associated with both apoptosis and necrosis is not explicitly listed in the options provided, but if we must choose the closest common feature, it would be a characteristic that can be seen in both processes, which would be a general cell death process.

What is the best next step in the management of this case?","['PRBC Transfusion', 'Vasopressors along with the inotropes', 'Immediate re-exploration of the mediastinum', 'Intra-aoic balloon pump']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old man who has just undergone a CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft) surgery and is now experiencing a sudden fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) 4 hours later.

2. Other findings include an elevated Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP), which suggests right-sided heart failure or fluid overload.

3. The patient's history of recent CABG surgery, the drop in MAP, and the elevated JVP point towards possible cardiac tamponade or fluid overload.

4. Cardiac tamponade is a serious condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, compressing the heart and impairing its ability to fill and pump effectively. Immediate re-exploration of the mediastinum is indicated to rule out this condition.

5. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is used for support in severe heart failure or unstable angina but is not the first-line in the scenario of suspected tamponade.

6. A PRBC (packed red blood cell) transfusion would be indicated if there was significant blood loss, which does not seem to be the case here.

7. Vasopressors and inotropes can support blood pressure and cardiac output but would not address the underlying issue of fluid overload or tamponade.

Given the symptoms and the recent surgical history, the most appropriate next step is to address the possibility of cardiac tamponade by re-exploring the mediastinum.

A. Short course of chemotherapy - While DOTS does involve a short course of anti-tuberculosis drugs, the term ""chemotherapy"" is more commonly used in oncology for cancer treatment. In the context of tuberculosis, it would be more accurate to describe it as a short course of anti-tuberculosis drugs. 

B. Drugs are given free of cost - This is a key component of DOTS, as it helps ensure that patients can adhere to the treatment without financial barriers.

C. Supervised drugs intake in intensive phase - This is a crucial aspect of DOTS to ensure patients take their medication correctly and to prevent the development of drug-resistant strains of TB.

D. Daily treatment is recommended - In the intensive phase of DOTS, patients are indeed recommended to take their medications daily.

The primary steps in this procedure include isolation of blood vessels, division of the bronchus, and removal of lymph nodes to prevent cancer spread. 

Option A, ligation of the pulmonary vein, is not the first step because the pulmonary veins carry deoxygenated blood to the heart, and their ligation would typically occur later in the procedure.

Option B, ligation of the pulmonary artery, is also not the first step as the pulmonary artery supplies oxygenated blood to the lung and would be managed later.

Option C, dividing the bronchus, is a crucial step but is not the very first step in a pneumonectomy. It is typically done after securing other structures.

Option D, performing lymph node clearance, is an essential part of the procedure to ensure the cancer does not spread. However, it is usually done after the main structures are secured and the bronchus is divided.

The first step in a pneumonectomy is to secure the blood supply, which includes ligating the pulmonary arteries and veins, but the primary and earliest step is to control the bronchus to prevent air leakage and ensure the surgery can proceed safely.

A. Binding of agonist: This is typically the action of the receptor, not the G-protein's alpha subunit. The agonist binds to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which then activates the G-protein.

B. Conversion of GDP to GTP: This is the correct action of the G-protein's alpha subunit. When a GPCR binds an agonist, it triggers a conformational change that activates the G-protein. The alpha subunit then exchanges GDP for GTP, which activates the G-protein and allows it to dissociate and activate downstream effector proteins.

C. Breakdown of GTP to GDP: This is not the action of the alpha subunit. Once the alpha subunit has hydrolyzed GTP to GDP, it returns to its inactive state and can be re-activated by binding GDP again.

D. Internalization of receptors: This is a cellular process where receptors are taken into the cell, which is not directly related to the action of the G-protein's alpha subunit.

The liver function tests are normal, and the common bile ducts are not dilated on ultrasound, which means there is no evidence of choledocholithiasis (stones in the bile ducts).

The procedure of choice for chronic calculous cholecystitis is typically a cholecystectomy, which can be performed either laparoscopically or via an open surgery. Given that the patient does not have evidence of bile duct stones or obstruction, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most appropriate and less invasive option.

Option B (Open choledocholithotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and Option C (ERCP + choledocholithotomy followed by Laparoscopic cholecystectomy) are unnecessary because there is no indication of choledocholithiasis. Option D (Laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by ERCP + choledocholithotomy) is also unnecessary and adds an extra procedure without a clear indication.

The most appropriate line of management for this patient is ?","['Classify as pneumonia and refer urgently to secondary level hospital', 'Classify as pneumonia, sta antibiotics and advise to repo after 2 days', 'Classify as severe pneumonia, sta antibiotics and refer urgently', 'Classify as severe pneumonia and refer urgently']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. **Age and Weight**: The child is 24 months old and weighs 11 kg. This is within the normal range for their age.

2. **Symptoms**: The child has a cough and fever, which are common symptoms of respiratory infections.

3. **Respiratory Rate and Indrawing**: The respiratory rate is 38 per minute, which is higher than the normal range for a 24-month-old (20-40 breaths per minute). Chest indrawing (inward movement of the chest wall during respiration) is a sign of significant respiratory distress, indicating severe respiratory distress.

4. **Classification and Management**:
   - **Pneumonia** is suspected due to the symptoms.
   - **Severe Pneumonia** is indicated by the presence of chest indrawing, which is a critical sign.
   - Immediate referral to a higher level of care (secondary or tertiary) is necessary due to the severity of symptoms.

5. **Management Options**:
   - **Option A** suggests an urgent referral to a secondary level hospital, which is appropriate but doesn't specify treatment.
   - **Option B** suggests starting antibiotics and a follow-up, which is less urgent and might delay necessary care.
   - **Option C** suggests starting antibiotics and urgent referral, which aligns with the severity of the condition.
   - **Option D** suggests urgent referral without mentioning antibiotics, which is also appropriate but might not cover the immediate need for treatment.

1. **Glucose**: During pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, some pregnant women develop gestational diabetes, leading to glucose appearing in the urine. Additionally, during lactation, the mother's body may excrete some glucose in the urine due to the metabolic demands of producing breast milk.

2. **Lactose**: Lactose is a sugar found in milk and dairy products. It is not typically present in urine under normal circumstances, as the body metabolizes it into glucose and galactose, which are then processed and not excreted in urine.

3. **Galactose**: Similar to lactose, galactose is metabolized by the body and not excreted in urine under normal conditions.

4. **Fructose**: Fructose is a sugar found in fruits and some vegetables, but it is not typically excreted in urine in significant amounts under normal conditions.

Given these considerations, the most likely substance to be found in the urine of a pregnant woman in the third trimester and during lactation is glucose due to the potential for gestational diabetes and the metabolic demands of lactation.

A supratrochanteric fracture is a fracture that occurs just above the trochanter, a prominent part of the femur. The proximal fragment refers to the part of the bone above the fracture line.

Now, let's consider the options:

A. Flexion - Flexion involves bending the knee, which would involve the lower part of the thigh bone (femur) but not specifically the proximal fragment in a supratrochanteric fracture.
B. Abduction - This involves moving the leg away from the midline of the body. While this can occur, it is not a specific movement associated with the proximal fragment in a supratrochanteric fracture.
C. External rotation - This involves turning the foot outward. This is a movement that involves the hip joint and the upper part of the femur, which is relevant to the proximal fragment in a supratrochanteric fracture.
D. All of the above - Given that flexion and abduction are not specific to the proximal fragment in a supratrochanteric fracture, and only external rotation is directly relevant, this option cannot be correct.

Considering the movements and their relevance to the proximal fragment in a supratrochanteric fracture, the correct answer is:

A. Lactose: Mother's milk contains a higher concentration of lactose compared to cow's milk. Lactose is the primary sugar in both, but mother's milk has more to meet the higher energy demands of a growing infant.

B. Vitamin D: Both mother's milk and cow's milk can be fortified with Vitamin D, but naturally, cow's milk is often fortified to a similar extent as mother's milk to meet nutritional needs. However, mother's milk does not naturally contain as much Vitamin D as cow's milk.

C. Proteins: Mother's milk has a different composition of proteins compared to cow's milk. It contains more whey proteins and less casein proteins, which are more easily digestible for infants. However, the total protein content is not necessarily higher in mother's milk.

D. Fat: Mother's milk typically contains less total fat than cow's milk. This is because the energy density of mother's milk is adapted to the infant's lower caloric needs compared to a calf.

Considering the above points, the most accurate answer is that mother's milk has more lactose compared to cow's milk.

Heroin overdose can lead to respiratory depression, which means the patient's breathing is slowed or stopped. This results in a buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood and a decrease in the pH of the blood, making it more acidic (a condition known as acidosis).

1. **Heart Rate and Blood Pressure**: The patient's heart rate is 45 beats/min, which is bradycardia, and blood pressure is 75/40 mm Hg, which suggests hypotension. These symptoms are consistent with heroin overdose.

2. **Blood Gas Analysis**:
   - **pH**: Since the patient is in respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation, the pH would be lower than normal (7.35-7.45).
   - **PaCO2**: CO2 levels would be elevated due to the respiratory depression, so PaCO2 would be higher than normal (40-45 mm Hg).
   - **HCO3-**: The bicarbonate levels would also be elevated as the body tries to buffer the excess CO2.

Looking at the options:

- **Option A**: pH 7.22, PaCO2 66, HCO3- 26. The pH is low and PaCO2 is high, which fits the picture of respiratory acidosis, but the HCO3- is too high. This combination is less likely.
- **Option B**: pH 7.34, PaCO2 29, HCO3- 15. The pH is slightly low, PaCO2 is low, and HCO3- is low, which suggests metabolic acidosis, not respiratory acidosis.
- **Option C**: pH 7.40, PaCO2 40, HCO3- 24. The pH is normal, PaCO2 is normal, and HCO3- is normal. This suggests no acidosis or alkalosis, which is unlikely in a patient with a heroin overdose.
- **Option D**: pH 7.47, PaCO2 20, HCO3- 14. The pH is slightly high, PaCO2 is low, and HCO3- is low. This suggests metabolic acidosis, which is less likely due to respiratory depression. However, the pH being high and PaCO2 being very low suggests that the patient might be in a state of respiratory depression, leading to hypoventilation and subsequent respiratory acidosis, with the body trying to compensate by lowering the pH.

2. **Permanent Canines (Option B)**: The permanent canines have a single antagonist in the lower jaw, the permanent central incisor. This meets the criteria of having a single antagonist.

3. **Permanent Central Incisors (Option C)**: These teeth have two antagonists in the lower jaw, the lateral incisor and the canine. Therefore, they do not have a single antagonist.

4. **Third Molars (Option D)**: Third molars, if present, do not have a single clear antagonist due to their location and the presence of other molars. They often have more than one opposing tooth.

Given the above reasoning, the permanent canines are the teeth that have a single antagonist.

2062,First indices to change in iron deficiency anemia is -,"['S. Iron', 'Total iron binding capacity', 'S. Ferritin', 'S. Haemoglobin concentration']","To determine the first indices to change in iron deficiency anemia, let's consider the typical sequence of changes in laboratory tests that reflect the body's iron stores and the resulting anemia.

1. **Serum Ferritin (S. Ferritin)**: This is a good indicator of body iron stores. When iron deficiency starts, serum ferritin levels are often the first to drop because ferritin is the main storage form of iron in the body. As iron deficiency progresses, serum ferritin levels decrease significantly before other changes become apparent.

2. **Serum Iron (S. Iron)**: This is the amount of iron in the blood, but it changes later in the course of iron deficiency anemia. It decreases when there's a significant depletion of iron stores.

3. **Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)**: This typically increases as a compensatory mechanism when serum iron levels decrease. However, this usually happens after the serum ferritin levels have already decreased.

4. **Serum Hemoglobin Concentration (S. Hemoglobin concentration)**: This is the final stage of iron deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin levels drop last as iron stores are severely depleted.

Given this information, the first indicator to change in iron deficiency anemia is serum ferritin.

2072,A person switches from high fat diet to low fat diet with compensatory increase in carbohydrates to maintain the same calories. Which of the following fat component will be increased ?,"['Chylomicron', 'VLDL', 'IDL', 'HDL']","When a person switches to a low-fat diet with a compensatory increase in carbohydrates, the body's metabolism adjusts to use the increased carbohydrate intake for energy. In the process of converting carbohydrates to fatty acids, the liver produces more very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are responsible for transporting triglycerides in the bloodstream. As a result of this increase in VLDL production, the levels of VLDL in the blood may rise.

Chylomicrons are primarily associated with the transport of dietary fats, including those from a high-fat diet, which is not the case here. IDL (Intermediate Density Lipoprotein) is usually formed from the remnants of VLDL after triglycerides have been removed. HDL (High Density Lipoprotein) is known as the ""good cholesterol"" and is not typically increased by changes in carbohydrate intake.

Therefore, the fat component that will be increased is VLDL.

2073,Hyaline in islets of Langerhans resemble -,"['Mucin', 'Amyloid', 'Glycolipid', 'Phospholipid']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what hyaline material in the islets of Langerhans is. The islets of Langerhans are clusters of cells in the pancreas that produce various hormones, including insulin and glucagon. Hyaline material in these islets is a type of extracellular matrix that can be seen in certain pathological conditions, such as diabetic nephropathy or in some forms of diabetes mellitus.

Hyaline material is typically described as a clear, amorphous substance that lacks the typical granular or crystalline structure of other substances. It is often associated with conditions that involve protein accumulation in the extracellular space, and it can be mistaken for mucin in histological stains.

Mucin is a type of glycoprotein that forms a gel-like substance and is commonly found in mucus-secreting tissues. Amyloid is a fibrous protein that can form plaques in various tissues, often associated with diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Glycolipids are fats that contain sugar molecules, and phospholipids are a type of lipid that forms the basis of cell membranes.

Given this information, the hyaline material in the islets of Langerhans most closely resembles mucin due to its clear, amorphous appearance and similar staining properties in histological sections.

A. Fluorine increases PTH levels by direct action: While it's known that fluoride can increase PTH levels, this is not the primary pathophysiological mechanism of skeletal fluorosis.

B. Fluoroappatite crystals are resistant to osteoclasts: This is a key point. Fluoride forms fluoroapatite, which is less soluble and more resistant to breakdown by osteoclasts, leading to the accumulation of fluoride in bone and the characteristic changes seen in skeletal fluorosis.

C. Fluorine decreases vitamin D levels: There is no direct evidence to suggest that fluoride decreases vitamin D levels. In fact, vitamin D is known to play a role in calcium absorption and bone health, but it does not directly link to the pathophysiology of skeletal fluorosis.

D. Fluorine erodes bone, thereby decreasing bone density: This is not accurate. Fluoride actually increases bone density by promoting the formation of fluoroapatite, but this can lead to bone fragility and other issues characteristic of skeletal fluorosis.

2075,"A 35-year-old woman, on hemodialysis for chronic renal disease, complains of pain in the hands. On examination, the joints are normal with no inflammation or tenderness on palpation. Lab values reveal a low calcium, high phosphate, and high PTH level. What is the most likely diagnosis? (See Figure below.)","['scleroderma', 'gout', 'secondary hyperparathyroidism', 'pseudogout']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. The patient is a 35-year-old woman on hemodialysis for chronic renal disease, which means she has end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

2. She complains of hand pain, but on examination, the joints appear normal with no inflammation or tenderness, ruling out conditions like gout or pseudogout which typically cause joint pain and inflammation.

3. The lab values show:
   - Low calcium: This is not typical for gout or pseudogout.
   - High phosphate: This can be seen in renal disease.
   - High PTH (Parathyroid Hormone): This is a key indicator for secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common complication of chronic renal disease.

4. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that develops as a result of chronic kidney disease. It occurs when the kidneys cannot effectively remove phosphorus from the blood, leading to high levels of phosphorus and low levels of calcium. The body responds by increasing PTH production to help regulate calcium and phosphorus levels. However, prolonged high PTH levels can lead to the deposition of calcium in soft tissues, including the hands, causing pain and other symptoms.

5. Given the patient's history of chronic renal disease, the lab values, and the normal joint examination, the most likely diagnosis is secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In severe aortic regurgitation, there is a significant backflow of blood into the left ventricle during systole, which increases the volume and pressure in the left ventricle. This results in a higher systolic blood pressure and a lower diastolic blood pressure, leading to an increased pulse pressure.

Studies and clinical guidelines indicate that in severe aortic regurgitation, the pulse pressure can be quite high, often in the range of 75-90 mmHg.

- **A. Vitamin B12 deficiency**: This is a well-known cause of macrocytic anemia, often referred to as megaloblastic anemia. A deficiency in B12 leads to the production of large, immature red blood cells.

- **B. Hemolytic anemia**: This condition involves the premature destruction of red blood cells. It typically results in microcytic or normocytic anemia, not macrocytic anemia. However, in rare cases, hemolytic anemia can be associated with macrocytosis, but this is not the primary cause.

- **C. Post hemorrhagic anemia**: This condition usually follows significant blood loss, leading to a decrease in overall circulating red blood cells. It typically results in normocytic or microcytic anemia, not macrocytic anemia.

- **D. Anemia of chronic disease**: This type of anemia is characterized by a low red blood cell count that is associated with chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions. It is usually normocytic or microcytic, not macrocytic.

Given this analysis, the condition that does not typically cause macrocytic anemia is **Post hemorrhagic anemia**.

2082,Patient came with hydrops and scarring of cornea. What would be the treatment modality you would opt for him:,"['Penetrating Keratoplasty', 'Endothelial lamellar Keratoplasty', 'Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty', 'Collagen cross linking']","To determine the most appropriate treatment for a patient with hydrops and scarring of the cornea, it's important to understand the nature of the condition and the role of each surgical option.

1. **Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK)**: This is a full-thickness corneal transplant where the entire thickness of the cornea is replaced. It is often used for severe cases of corneal disease but is more invasive.

2. **Endothelial Lamellar Keratoplasty (EAK)**: This procedure only replaces the endothelial layer and is typically used for conditions that affect the back of the cornea, such as Fuchs' dystrophy, where the endothelial cells are damaged.

3. **Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK)**: This procedure replaces only the anterior layers of the cornea, excluding the endothelium. It is used for conditions that affect the anterior part of the cornea, such as keratoconus or corneal scars, without damaging the endothelial cells.

4. **Collagen Cross Linking**: This is a non-surgical procedure that strengthens the corneal structure by promoting collagen fiber cross-linking, often used to treat progressive keratoconus.

Given that the patient has both hydrops and scarring of the cornea, a procedure that addresses both the anterior and posterior layers of the cornea would be most appropriate. Hydrops, which can result from Descemet's membrane detachment and subsequent fluid accumulation, often requires a procedure that can stabilize the posterior layers of the cornea as well.

Therefore, the most suitable treatment modality would be **Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK)**, as it addresses the anterior layers while preserving the endothelial layer, which is crucial for maintaining the cornea's function and reducing the risk of rejection.

2088,Patient is on Autocoids for 1 year now complains of severe pain Epigastrium relieved by antacid drugs. He complaints of Right Iliac fossa pain and loss of liver dullness. Diagnosis is:,"['Perforation of duodenum', 'Diverticulitis', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Enteric perforation']","Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history to determine the correct diagnosis.

1. **Patient's medical history and current symptoms:**
   - The patient is on autocoids (likely referring to corticosteroids) for 1 year.
   - The patient is experiencing severe pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen) that is relieved by antacid drugs, suggesting a possible peptic ulcer or gastritis.
   - The patient also has pain in the right iliac fossa (lower right abdomen) and a loss of liver dullness, which indicates air in the abdomen, possibly due to a perforation.

2. **Evaluating the options:**
   - **A. Perforation of duodenum:** This could explain the epigastric pain and the presence of air in the abdomen leading to loss of liver dullness. However, the pain in the right iliac fossa is more suggestive of an enteric perforation rather than a duodenal perforation.
   - **B. Diverticulitis:** This condition typically causes pain in the lower abdomen, often in the left lower quadrant, and might not explain the epigastric pain or the liver dullness.

2090,Transplacental exchanges that take place are essential to the well being of the fetus. Which of those listed below is NOT a method?,"['Simple diffusion', 'Active transpo', 'Endocytosis', 'Exocytosis']","To determine which option is not a method of transplacental exchange, let's consider each option in the context of fetal development and maternal-fetal exchange processes:

A. Simple diffusion - This is a method where molecules move across a cell membrane from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This is commonly used for the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) and other small molecules between the mother and the fetus.

B. Active transport - This involves the movement of molecules across a cell membrane with the help of a carrier protein and energy, typically in the form of ATP. This is used for the transport of larger or charged molecules that cannot easily cross the membrane through simple diffusion.

C. Endocytosis - This is a process where the cell membrane engulfs substances and brings them into the cell. This is used for the uptake of large particles or molecules that cannot pass through the membrane via simple diffusion or active transport.

D. Exocytosis - This is the opposite of endocytosis, where substances are secreted out of the cell. This is not a method of transplacental exchange because it involves the release of substances from the cell, not the uptake of substances from the maternal blood into the fetal blood.

Since exocytosis is not a method of transplacental exchange, the final answer is D.",D,0.9973437887010574,D,True

2121,Light requirement in watch manufacturing company is -,"['2000-3000 Lux', '5000-10000 Lux', '10000-20000 Lux', '50000 Lux']","To determine the correct light requirement for a watch manufacturing company, it is important to consider the precision and detail work required. Watches, especially intricate ones, need to be inspected and assembled under conditions that allow for very fine visual inspection.

- Option A (2000-3000 Lux) is generally too dim for detailed work, especially in watchmaking.
- Option B (5000-10000 Lux) is more appropriate for tasks requiring high visibility but may still be insufficient for the intricate work and detail-oriented processes in watchmaking.
- Option C (10000-20000 Lux) is suitable for tasks that require high visibility and precision, making it a strong candidate for watch manufacturing.
- Option D (50000 Lux) is extremely bright and would be unnecessarily harsh and potentially harmful for the workers' eyes.

Given the need for high precision and detail in watch manufacturing, the light requirement should be high enough to provide excellent visibility without being overly harsh.

2122,Estimation of the following hormones is useful while investigating a case of gynecomastia except-,"['Testosterone', 'Prolactin', 'Estradiol', 'Luteinising hormone']","To determine which hormone's estimation is not useful in investigating a case of gynecomastia, let's consider the roles of each hormone mentioned:

- **Testosterone**: This is the primary male sex hormone. Low levels of testosterone can sometimes contribute to gynecomastia, but it is not the most commonly evaluated hormone for this condition.
- **Prolactin**: Elevated prolactin levels can lead to gynecomastia by stimulating breast tissue growth. Therefore, measuring prolactin levels is relevant in this context.
- **Estradiol**: Estradiol is a form of estrogen. Elevated estradiol levels can cause gynecomastia by promoting breast tissue growth in males.
- **Luteinising Hormone (LH)**: LH stimulates the production of testosterone in the testes. While LH levels can be indicative of testicular function, they are not directly related to the development of gynecomastia.

Given these points, the hormone whose estimation is least useful in investigating a case of gynecomastia is:

2124,Lancinating pain around the tonsils during eating is indicative of,"['Trigeminal neuralgia', 'Glossopharyngeal neuralgia', 'Facial neuralgia', 'None of the above']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the symptoms described:

- **Lancinating pain** is a sharp, stabbing pain that comes and goes suddenly.
- **Around the tonsils** suggests the pain is localized in the throat area.
- **During eating** implies the pain is triggered by specific actions.

**A. Trigeminal neuralgia** typically causes sharp, shooting pain on one side of the face, usually around the cheek, jaw, or lips. It is not commonly associated with the throat or tonsils.

**B. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia** involves pain in the back of the throat, tongue, ear, and base of the skull. This condition can indeed cause sharp, lancinating pain that might be triggered by swallowing or eating.

**C. Facial neuralgia** generally refers to pain in the face, similar to trigeminal neuralgia, but it does not specifically target the throat or tonsils.

**D. None of the above** would only be correct if neither trigeminal neuralgia nor glossopharyngeal neuralgia were applicable, which is not the case here.

Given the localized nature of the pain around the tonsils and its occurrence during eating, the most likely cause is **glossopharyngeal neuralgia**.

2126,"Cause of ""bloody"" vomitus in a neonate","[""Meckel's diveiculum"", 'Intussusception', 'Malrotation', 'Cholecystitis']","To determine the correct cause of ""bloody"" vomitus in a neonate, let's consider each option:

A. Meckel's diverticulum: This is a congenital condition where a small pouch forms in the wall of the small intestine. It can occasionally cause bleeding, leading to hematemesis (vomiting blood), especially in neonates. However, it is less common and not as frequently the cause of bloody vomiting in neonates compared to other conditions.

B. Intussusception: This is a condition where one part of the intestine telescopes into another, causing a blockage and often leading to severe abdominal pain, bloody stool (which can be mistaken for bloody vomitus), and sometimes vomiting. It is a common and serious cause of bloody vomiting in neonates.

C. Malrotation: This is a congenital condition where the intestines do not form properly, leading to malpositioning. It can cause obstruction, ischemia, and can result in bloody vomiting, particularly in neonates.

D. Cholecystitis: This is inflammation of the gallbladder, typically due to gallstones. While it can cause vomiting, it is not a common cause of bloody vomiting in neonates.

Considering the symptoms and commonality in neonates, the most likely cause is intussusception, as it frequently presents with bloody stool (which can be confused with bloody vomitus) and vomiting.

2127,Natural uncoupler is-,"['Thermogenin', '2, 4-dinitrocresol', '2, 4 Dinitrophenol', 'Oligomycin']","To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what a natural uncoupler is. An uncoupler is a substance that disrupts the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, leading to the uncoupling of the energy released from electron transport from ATP synthesis. This results in the direct conversion of the energy into heat rather than being used to synthesize ATP.

Now, let's look at the options:
A. Thermogenin: This is a protein found in brown adipose tissue that helps in the production of heat by uncoupling the electron transport chain. However, it is not a natural uncoupler in the sense of a small molecule that can be used for experimental purposes in cells.
B. 2, 4-dinitrocresol: This is a chemical known to be an uncoupler, but it is not a natural substance.
C. 2, 4 Dinitrophenol: This is a well-known uncoupler that can be used experimentally to disrupt the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It is not a natural substance but is often used in studies to understand mitochondrial function.
D. Oligomycin: This substance actually inhibits the F1F0 ATP synthase, thereby preventing the production of ATP rather than uncoupling the electron transport chain.

Given this information, the closest to a natural uncoupler would be option A, thermogenin, as it is a protein naturally found in the body that serves to uncouple the electron transport chain in brown adipose tissue. However, strictly speaking, among the provided options, 2, 4 Dinitrophenol (C) is the most commonly recognized uncoupler.

2128,Venous congestion of liver affects ?,"['Midzone', 'Perihepatic zone', 'Centrilobular zone', 'All the above']","To determine which zone of the liver is affected by venous congestion, we need to understand the structure of the liver and how venous congestion might impact it.

The liver is divided into zones based on their distance from the portal vein and hepatic artery. These zones are:
- Periportal zone (outermost zone, closest to the portal vein)
- Midzone
- Centrilobular zone (innermost zone, closest to the central vein)

Venous congestion typically affects the areas of the liver that are more dependent on venous return. Since the centrilobular zone is the deepest and relies heavily on venous outflow, it is most prone to congestion. The periportal zone has better collateral venous drainage, making it less affected. The midzone is in between and can be affected to some degree.

Given this understanding, venous congestion primarily affects the centrilobular zone, but it can also involve the midzone and perihepatic zone to a lesser extent.

Initially, there was a 3-cm contusion beneath the skin that resolved within 3 weeks, but she then felt a firm, painless lump that persisted below the site of the bruise 1 month later. What is the most likely diagnosis for this lump?","['Abscess', 'Fat necrosis', 'Fibroadenoma', 'Inflammatory carcinoma']","Let's reason through the options given the patient's history and the description of the lump:

1. **Abscess**: An abscess would typically present with signs of infection such as redness, warmth, pain, and possibly fever. Since the patient described a firm, painless lump, this does not align well with an abscess.

2. **Fat Necrosis**: This condition is often seen after a physical trauma, such as a blow to the breast. It can result in the formation of a firm, painless lump that persists over time. The patient's history of a 3-cm contusion that resolved but was followed by a persistent lump is consistent with fat necrosis.

3. **Fibroadenoma**: Fibroadenomas are typically smooth, round, and mobile breast lumps that are painless and firm, but they usually do not develop after a traumatic event like a contusion. They are more common in younger women but can occur in older women as well.

4. **Inflammatory Carcinoma**: This is a type of breast cancer that presents with pain, redness, and swelling. The patient described a painless lump, which does not align with inflammatory carcinoma.

Given the patient's history of trauma followed by the development of a firm, painless lump, the most likely diagnosis is fat necrosis.

2135,Drug with membrane stabilizing activity is?,"['Nadolol', 'Atenolol', 'Carvedilol', 'Oxprenolol']","To answer this question, let's first understand what ""membrane stabilizing activity"" means. Membrane stabilizing activity refers to a drug's ability to stabilize cell membranes, which can be beneficial in conditions like arrhythmias by reducing the excitability of cardiac tissue.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. Nadolol - This is a beta-blocker that blocks both β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors. It does not primarily stabilize cell membranes but is used for hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias.

B. Atenolol - Similar to Nadolol, Atenolol is a selective β1 adrenergic receptor blocker, used primarily for the treatment of hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias. It does not have significant membrane-stabilizing properties.

C. Carvedilol - This is a non-selective beta-blocker that also has alpha-blocking properties. It has been shown to have some membrane-stabilizing effects, which contribute to its therapeutic benefits, especially in the management of heart failure and hypertension.

D. Oxprenolol - This is a beta-blocker with a propranolol-like structure but is less potent. It is used to treat hypertension and angina but does not have notable membrane-stabilizing properties.

Given the information, Carvedilol (option C) is the drug that has membrane-stabilizing activity.

2136,A decrease in which of the following parameters will shift the O2 dissociation curve to the right?,"['pH', 'Paial pressure of CO2', '2,3 DPG concentration', 'Temperature']","To determine which parameter will shift the O2 dissociation curve to the right, we need to understand the factors that influence the curve. The O2 dissociation curve represents the amount of oxygen that hemoglobin can release to tissues as a function of the oxygen tension (PaO2) in the blood. Shifts to the right mean that hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily to tissues at a given oxygen tension.

- **A. pH**: A decrease in pH (more acidic) shifts the O2 dissociation curve to the right, according to the Bohr effect. This means hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily in tissues where pH is lower, such as in metabolically active tissues.
- **B. Partial pressure of CO2**: An increase in partial pressure of CO2 (higher CO2) shifts the O2 dissociation curve to the right, also due to the Bohr effect. This means hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily in tissues where CO2 levels are higher.
- **C. 2,3 DPG concentration**: An increase in 2,3 DPG concentration shifts the O2 dissociation curve to the right. 2,3 DPG is a compound that binds to hemoglobin and promotes the release of oxygen, especially in the tissues.
- **D. Temperature**: An increase in temperature shifts the O2 dissociation curve to the right. Higher temperatures increase the rate of dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin.

All of these factors (except for a decrease in pH, which shifts the curve to the left) will shift the O2 dissociation curve to the right, making hemoglobin release oxygen more readily. However, the question asks for a decrease in a parameter, which means we need to identify the option that, when decreased, will shift the curve to the right. This would be a decrease in 2,3 DPG concentration, which shifts the curve to the left. But since we are looking for a decrease that shifts it to the right, we need to consider the inverse effect.

2138,A triphasic withdrawal syndrome follows an abrupt discontinuation of ______ use.,"['Alcohol', 'LSD', 'Heroin', 'Cocaine']","To determine the correct answer, let's first consider what a triphasic withdrawal syndrome is. This term typically refers to a pattern of withdrawal symptoms that occur in three distinct phases. It is most commonly associated with the abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines, which are a class of drugs that include tranquilizers and sedatives.

Given the options provided:

A. Alcohol - While alcohol withdrawal can be severe and involves multiple phases, it is not typically described as a ""triphasic"" syndrome.
B. LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) - Withdrawal symptoms from LSD are generally not categorized as a triphasic syndrome.
C. Heroin - Withdrawal from heroin typically follows a different pattern and is not described as triphasic.
D. Cocaine - Cocaine withdrawal can have multiple phases but is not specifically characterized as triphasic.

Among the options, benzodiazepines are the most closely associated with triphasic withdrawal syndrome. However, since benzodiazepines are not listed among the options, we must consider the closest related substance, which in this context would be a sedative that could be confused with benzodiazepines. Given the typical use and effects, the closest related substance that fits the description of a triphasic withdrawal syndrome would be alcohol, as it is a depressant that can cause a similar pattern of withdrawal symptoms.

A. Retinoic acid is used in treatment - There is no strong evidence to support the use of retinoic acid in the treatment of PML. The standard treatment for PML is to address the underlying immunosuppression, often through treatment of the underlying condition (like HIV or cancer).

B. 15/17 translocation - This refers to a genetic alteration found in some subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly in cases with the Philadelphia chromosome. This is not typically associated with PML.

C. CD 15/34 both seen in same cell - CD15 and CD34 are markers used in the diagnosis of certain hematological malignancies. PML is caused by the JC virus and is not associated with these specific markers.

D. Associated with DIVC - This likely stands for Drug-Induced Vasculopathy, which is not a recognized term in relation to PML. However, PML can occur in patients with certain underlying conditions that affect the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS or after the use of immunosuppressive drugs.

Given the above analysis, the statement that does not apply to PML is A, as retinoic acid is not a standard treatment for PML.

2. **Blood Parameters**:
   - Hemoglobin (Hb): 60 g/L (severely low)
   - Total Leukocyte Count (TLC): 5800 (normal range is 4,000-10,000/µL)
   - Platelets: 3.4 lakhs (normal range is 150,000-450,000/µL)
   - Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): 60 (indicative of microcytic anemia)
   - RBC count: 2.1 lakhs/mm3 (indicative of anemia)

3. **Hemoglobin Profile**: Hypochromic microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia, which can be due to chronic blood loss, malnutrition, or other causes.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

**A. Evaluation for Pulmonary Hemosiderosis**: Pulmonary hemosiderosis is a condition where there is chronic bleeding in the lungs, leading to hemosiderin deposition. Given the hypochromic microcytic anemia, it is a possibility, but not the most likely cause without additional clinical context.

**B. Urinary Hemosiderin**: This test can help detect hemosiderinuria, which is a sign of hemolysis. However, it is not the primary test to establish the cause of iron deficiency anemia.

**C. Bone Marrow Examination**: This is a crucial test to determine the cause of anemia, especially in cases of microcytic anemia. It can help identify if the anemia is due to bone marrow failure, iron deficiency, or other causes.

**D. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy**: This test is important to rule out sources of chronic bleeding, such as peptic ulcers, tumors, or other gastrointestinal conditions that could be causing iron deficiency anemia.

Given the patient's history and anemia profile, it is essential to rule out sources of chronic bleeding, which is best done with a gastrointestinal endoscopy. While a bone marrow examination and evaluation for pulmonary hemosiderosis are important, they are not as directly relevant as a GI endoscopy in this context.

A. The distal nephron has a more negative intraluminal potential than the proximal tubule.
- The intraluminal potential is generally more negative in the proximal tubule due to the active transport of ions and reabsorption of substances, making this statement incorrect.

B. The distal nephron is less responsive to aldosterone than the proximal tubule.
- The distal nephron is more responsive to aldosterone, which promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. The proximal tubule is less responsive to aldosterone. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

C. The distal nephron is more permeable to hydrogen ion than the proximal tubule.
- The proximal tubule has a higher permeability to hydrogen ions due to the presence of the brush border membrane, which facilitates the secretion of hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen. The distal nephron has lower permeability to hydrogen ions. Thus, this statement is incorrect.

D. The distal nephron secretes more hydrogen ion than the proximal tubule does.
- The distal nephron plays a significant role in secreting hydrogen ions into the tubular fluid, which is crucial for acid-base balance. The proximal tubule does not have the same level of hydrogen ion secretion. Therefore, this statement is correct.

- **Arginine (A)**: Arginine has a basic side chain (guanidino group), which is not particularly important for buffering.
- **Aspartic acid (B)**: Aspartic acid has a negatively charged carboxyl group (-COO\^-), which can help in buffering but is not the primary amino acid involved in the buffering capacity of hemoglobin.
- **Glutamic acid (C)**: Glutamic acid also has a negatively charged carboxyl group (-COO\^-), similar to aspartic acid, and is not primarily responsible for the buffering capacity of hemoglobin.
- **Histidine (D)**: Histidine has an imidazole ring in its side chain, which can act as both a proton donor and acceptor, making it highly effective in buffering solutions. Histidine is a key component in the buffering capacity of hemoglobin, where it can exist in different protonation states, thus stabilizing the pH.

A. Amebic abscess: This is a localized infection caused by the amoeba *Entamoeba histolytica* and can cause a mass in the liver, leading to diaphragmatic elevation.

B. Pyogenic abscess: This is a collection of pus caused by infection. A pyogenic abscess in the liver can also cause diaphragmatic elevation due to the pressure from the abscess.

C. Cholecystitis: This is inflammation of the gallbladder, usually caused by gallstones or infection. While it can cause pain and inflammation, it does not typically cause diaphragmatic elevation unless it leads to significant complications like a liver abscess.

D. Subdiaphragmatic abscess: This is an abscess below the diaphragm, which would directly cause diaphragmatic elevation as it pushes the diaphragm upwards.

Based on this reasoning, cholecystitis (C) is the condition that is less likely to cause diaphragmatic elevation compared to the others, as it does not usually lead to such a complication unless it results in a liver abscess.

2156,"The parietal peritoneum covering the inferior surface of the diaphragm transits its sensory information via the phrenic nerve. In the case of peritonitis in the parietal peritoneum on the inferior surface of the diaphragm, pain may be referred through which of the following nerves?","['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']","To determine the correct nerve that would refer pain in this scenario, we need to consider the anatomy and innervation of the parietal peritoneum and the diaphragm.

The parietal peritoneum covering the inferior surface of the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve, which originates from the cervical spinal cord (C3, C4, and C5). The phrenic nerve provides motor innervation to the diaphragm and sensory innervation to the parietal peritoneum.

When there is peritonitis in this area, the pain would be transmitted along the sensory fibers of the phrenic nerve. However, the phrenic nerve itself does not have a letter designation in the options provided (A, B, C, D). Instead, it is likely that the question is asking about the nerve that might refer this pain to other areas, but the phrenic nerve itself is the one directly involved in the sensory innervation.

1. **Erythromycin (Option A)**: While this antibiotic can be used to prevent diphtheria in close contacts, it is not the recommended first-line treatment for exposed individuals who are non-immunized and susceptible.

2. **Penicillin and Diphtheria Antitoxin (Option B)**: This combination is often used in severe cases or for those who are allergic to erythromycin. However, the primary focus for susceptible contacts is on preventing the disease rather than treating an established infection.

3. **Penicillin, Diphtheria Antitoxin, and DPT Vaccine (Option C)**: This option addresses both the need to prevent the disease through the vaccine (DPT) and provide immediate protection with antitoxin. Penicillin is used to prevent secondary bacterial infections, but the key focus is on the vaccine and antitoxin to prevent or mitigate the disease.

4. **No treatment is required (Option D)**: This is incorrect as it does not address the need for preventive measures in non-immunized and susceptible individuals.

Given the need to protect non-immunized and susceptible individuals from diphtheria, the most comprehensive and appropriate approach is to vaccinate them and provide them with diphtheria antitoxin.

- The patient developed sudden hypertension (HTN) and bleeding from all places (generalized bleeding).
- DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) is a condition where widespread clotting in small blood vessels leads to both bleeding and organ dysfunction, often following sepsis, severe infections, or other conditions.
- Aplastic anemia is a condition where the bone marrow stops producing enough new blood cells, leading to anemia, increased risk of infection, and bleeding, but it does not typically present with sudden HTN.
- ITP (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) is a bleeding disorder where the body's immune system destroys platelets, leading to easy bruising and bleeding, but it does not usually cause sudden HTN.
- APLA (Antiphospholipid Syndrome) involves the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which can lead to blood clots and recurrent miscarriages, but it is less likely to present with sudden HTN and generalized bleeding without the context of thrombotic events.

Given the sudden onset of HTN and bleeding from all places, DIC is the most likely diagnosis as it can cause both hypertension and a bleeding tendency due to widespread clotting and subsequent consumptive coagulopathy.

2161,A patient with hypeension is also having aoic dissection. Anti-hypeensive agent of choice is: September 2008,"['Sodium nitroprusside', 'Reserpine', 'Pindolol', 'Nifedipine']","Let's reason through this:

1. **Aortic Dissection:** This is a serious condition where there is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, allowing blood to get between the layers of the aorta. This can lead to a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly.

2. **Anti-Hypertensive Agents:**
   - **Sodium Nitroprusside:** This is a potent vasodilator that can rapidly lower blood pressure and is often used in critical care settings, especially in cases of severe hypertension with aortic dissection. It works by relaxing the blood vessels.
   - **Reserpine:** This is an older antihypertensive agent that works by decreasing the amount of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the body. It is generally not used as a first-line agent for acute hypertension.
   - **Pindolol:** This is a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, which means it can both block the effects of adrenaline and mimic some of its effects. While it can be used in hypertension, it is not typically the first choice for acute aortic dissection.
   - **Nifedipine:** This is a calcium channel blocker and is effective in lowering blood pressure, but it can cause reflex tachycardia (increased heart rate) which may be problematic in a patient with aortic dissection.

Given the urgency and the need for rapid control of blood pressure in a patient with aortic dissection, **Sodium Nitroprusside** is the most appropriate choice due to its rapid onset of action and effectiveness in managing severe hypertension.

- **A. Isthmus of thyroid**: The isthmus of the thyroid gland is a small, narrow band of thyroid tissue that connects the two lobes of the thyroid gland. During an emergency tracheostomy, the incision is typically made below the thyroid gland to avoid major thyroid structures. The isthmus is usually not directly damaged in this procedure.

- **B. Inferior thyroid vein**: The inferior thyroid vein lies deep to the thyroid gland and is involved with venous drainage. In an emergency tracheostomy, the neck is incised in the midline, which can inadvertently damage the inferior thyroid vein.

- **C. Inferior thyroid artery**: The inferior thyroid artery is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk and lies deep to the thyroid gland. During an emergency tracheostomy, the risk of damaging this artery exists due to its deep location.

- **D. Thyroid ima artery**: The thyroid ima artery is a small branch of the thyrocervical trunk that can arise from the aorta and supply the isthmus of the thyroid. It can be damaged during an emergency tracheostomy if the incision is made too low or if the dissection is too deep.

Given this analysis, the structure that is least likely to be directly damaged during an emergency tracheostomy is the isthmus of the thyroid.

2164,Which of the following is the best test to diagnose bleeding in DIC?,"['Increased PT', 'Increased aPTT', 'Decreased fibrinogen', 'Increased fibrin degradation products']","To determine the best test for diagnosing bleeding in DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation), we need to understand what each option indicates:

- **A. Increased PT (Prothrombin Time)**: PT is a test that measures the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. An increase in PT suggests a deficiency in factors of this pathway, which is not typically the primary issue in DIC where the problem often lies with fibrinolysis and consumption of clotting factors.

- **B. Increased aPTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time)**: aPTT measures the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. An increase in aPTT could indicate a deficiency in intrinsic pathway factors, but again, this is not the primary concern in DIC where coagulation factors are being consumed and fibrinolysis is activated.

- **C. Decreased Fibrinogen**: This is a direct indicator of consumption of clotting factors due to the intense clotting activity in DIC. The body consumes fibrinogen to form clots, leading to a decrease in its levels.

- **D. Increased Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs)**: FDPs are produced as fibrin is broken down during the fibrinolysis process. An increase in FDPs indicates that there is ongoing fibrinolysis, which is a hallmark of DIC.

Given these points, the best indicator of bleeding in DIC would be increased levels of fibrin degradation products (FDPs), as this directly reflects the fibrinolysis process that occurs in DIC.

2167,Initial stage of clinical union of bone is equivalent to,"['Callus formation with woven bone', 'Woven bone Formation', 'Haematoma formation', 'Calcification formation only']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the stages of bone healing:

1. **Hematoma Formation**: This is the initial stage where blood vessels are damaged and a clot (hematoma) forms around the site of injury. While this is a necessary step for healing, it is not the initial stage of clinical union.

2. **Woven Bone Formation**: After the hematoma, the next stage involves the formation of woven bone. This type of bone is weak and disorganized but serves as a scaffold for the new bone formation.

3. **Callus Formation with Woven Bone**: This stage involves the formation of a callus, which is a mass of connective tissue and woven bone that bridges the gap in the bone. This is a more advanced stage of healing than just woven bone formation alone.

4. **Calcification Formation Only**: This refers to the process where the woven bone is replaced by more organized, calcified bone (lamellar bone) through a process called remodeling. However, this is a later stage of healing.

Given these descriptions, the initial stage of clinical union, where the bone starts to unite, involves the formation of woven bone as part of the callus formation.

The example demonstrated by the dentist falls under which type of conditioning, as described by Skinner?","['Positive reinforcement', 'Negative reinforcement', 'Omission', 'Punishment']","To determine the type of conditioning demonstrated in the scenario, let's break it down:

1. **Positive Reinforcement (A)**: This occurs when a behavior is strengthened by the addition of a desirable stimulus. In this case, the dentist did not add a stimulus to make the child cooperate; rather, the removal of the mother seemed to have an effect.

2. **Negative Reinforcement (B)**: This occurs when a behavior is strengthened by the removal or avoidance of an unpleasant stimulus. Here, the dentist removed the mother, which seemed to remove the child's anxiety or discomfort, making her more cooperative. This aligns with the concept of negative reinforcement, where an unpleasant situation (the child's tantrum) was removed to increase the likelihood of the cooperative behavior.

3. **Omission (C)**: This is not a term commonly used in the context of behavioral psychology as described by Skinner. It generally refers to the removal of an action or behavior, not a type of reinforcement.

4. **Punishment (D)**: This involves decreasing the likelihood of a behavior by presenting an aversive stimulus. The scenario does not describe any aversive stimulus being added to decrease the child's tantrum.

Given the scenario, the child became more cooperative when the mother was removed, which aligns with the idea of negative reinforcement.

Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. When insulin is secreted, it is often accompanied by another molecule in a specific ratio. The correct companion to insulin in a 1:1 ratio is C-peptide, which is a byproduct of the proinsulin molecule that is cleaved during the formation of insulin. C-peptide is not biologically active but serves as a marker for insulin production and secretion.

Let's analyze the options:
A. Pancreatic polypeptide - This is not secreted in a 1:1 ratio with insulin.
B. Glucagon - This is another hormone secreted by the pancreas but not in a 1:1 ratio with insulin.
C. GLP-1 (Glucagon-like peptide-1) - While GLP-1 plays a role in glucose homeostasis, it is not secreted in a 1:1 ratio with insulin.
D. C-peptide - This is the correct answer as it is secreted in a 1:1 ratio with insulin.

2181,A 23 year old profession footballer sufferd a twisting injury to his right ankle. On examination there is a lot of swelling around the medial malleolus but xray doesn't show any fracture. The structure injured could be -,"['Deltoid Ligament', 'Anterior talofibular ligament', 'Spring ligament', 'Tendo Achilles']","Let's reason through the given scenario:

- The patient is a 23-year-old professional footballer who experienced a twisting injury to the right ankle.
- On examination, there is significant swelling around the medial malleolus (the inner part of the ankle).
- An x-ray did not show any fractures.

The key points here are:
1. The injury involves the medial malleolus, which is the inner part of the ankle where the tibia meets the ankle.
2. Significant swelling is noted, which suggests a soft tissue injury.
3. No fractures were seen on the x-ray, so we are looking at a ligament injury rather than a bony one.

Now, let's consider the options:
A. Deltoid Ligament - This ligament is located on the medial side of the ankle and connects the tibia to the navicular bone. It is commonly injured in medial ankle sprains, and its location and function align well with the symptoms described.
B. Anterior talofibular ligament - This ligament is located on the lateral side of the ankle and is more commonly involved in lateral ankle sprains, not medial ones.
C. Spring ligament - This ligament is not typically associated with injuries to the medial malleolus. It is more relevant to the calcaneus and the cuboid.
D. Tendo Achilles - This is the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel bone. It is not involved in the medial side of the ankle.

Given the swelling around the medial malleolus and the absence of fractures, the most likely structure injured is the Deltoid Ligament.

A. Left to right shunt: VSDs are characterized by a left to right shunt, where blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle because of the defect in the ventricular septum. This is a common and true characteristic of VSDs.

B. Pansystolic murmur: A VSD typically results in a continuous machinery-like murmur, but during an examination, a pansystolic murmur (a murmur that occurs throughout the entire systole) is commonly heard. This is also a characteristic of VSDs.

C. Reverse splitting of S2: Splitting of the second heart sound (S2) is usually a sign of right-to-left splitting in conditions like pulmonary stenosis, where the right ventricular outflow is narrowed. VSDs do not typically cause reverse splitting of S2. Instead, there is usually no splitting or a fixed split S2 due to the left-to-right shunt. This is the characteristic that does not apply to VSDs.

D. Left atrial hypertrophy: Due to the increased volume of blood flowing into the left side of the heart, left atrial hypertrophy can occur in patients with VSDs. This is a true characteristic of VSDs.

Given the analysis, the statement that does not apply to VSDs is C. Reverse splitting of S2.

Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that originates in the plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell found primarily in the bone marrow. The disease results in the abnormal proliferation of these plasma cells, leading to the formation of tumors in the bone marrow. Since the plasma cells are predominantly located in the bone marrow, it is the primary site involved in multiple myeloma.

Let's review the options:
A. Bone marrow - This is where plasma cells are found and where multiple myeloma originates.
B. Cortex of bone - While the bone marrow is within the bone, the cortex of the bone is the outer, hard layer of the bone and is less likely to be involved directly in myeloma.
C. Metaphyses - These are the parts of the bone near the growth plate and are not the primary site for multiple myeloma.
D. Epiphyses - These are the ends of long bones and are also not the primary site for multiple myeloma.

A. **Tetralogy of Fallot**: This is a combination of four heart defects that affect the right side of the heart. It results in cyanosis (blue skin color) due to a large ventricular septal defect that allows oxygen-poor blood to flow from the right ventricle to the left ventricle, mixing with oxygen-rich blood.

B. **TAPVC (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection)**: In this condition, the pulmonary veins that carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium do not connect properly, leading to cyanosis if the defect is severe.

C. **Transposition of Great Vessels**: This is a condition where the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched in position, so that the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. This leads to cyanosis because the oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood are not properly separated.

D. **Ebstein's Anomaly**: This is a rare heart defect where the tricuspid valve (the valve between the right atrium and the right ventricle) is malformed, causing a combination of right-sided heart failure and cyanosis.

Erythropoietin promotes the survival of early erythroid progenitor cells primarily through which of the following mechanisms?","['Altered cell-matrix adhesion', 'Downregulation of p53', 'Enhanced glucose uptake', 'Inhibition of apoptosis']","To answer this question, we need to understand the role of erythropoietin (EPO) and its mechanism of action on hematopoietic stem cells. Erythropoietin primarily stimulates the production and survival of red blood cells by targeting erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. EPO exerts its effects primarily by inhibiting apoptosis (programmed cell death) of these cells, which is a critical process in the increased production of red blood cells needed to address the lower oxygen levels at high altitudes.

Let's briefly review the other options to ensure that EPO does not act through them:
- A. Altered cell-matrix adhesion: While adhesion molecules are important for cell survival and function, EPO does not primarily work through altering cell-matrix adhesion.
- B. Downregulation of p53: p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that can induce apoptosis. While EPO might indirectly affect p53 function, it is not the primary mechanism for promoting erythroid cell survival.

B. ""It measures the thing it expected to measure"" - This aligns with the definition of validity. A valid indicator is one that accurately measures the specific variable or concept it is intended to measure.

C. ""Over value when measured by different method"" - This refers to overestimation, which is a sign of bias or inaccuracy, not validity. Validity is about measuring the correct thing, not the amount of value.

D. ""Under value when measured by different method"" - This refers to underestimation, which is also a sign of inaccuracy, not validity.

Given this reasoning, the correct definition of a valid indicator is that it measures the thing it expected to measure.

1. **Hemiplegia**: This refers to paralysis on one side of the body. It is commonly associated with a stroke affecting the motor cortex.

2. **Diminution of vision in the contralateral eye**: This suggests that the visual pathway on the opposite side is affected. The visual pathway involves the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and the occipital lobe.

In ischemic stroke, the occlusion of major cerebral arteries can lead to these symptoms. The arteries supplying blood to the brain are the internal carotid artery (which supplies the anterior two-thirds of the brain) and the vertebrobasilar system (which supplies the posterior one-third).

- **Middle cerebral artery**: Supplies the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere and is responsible for the motor and sensory functions of the opposite side of the body, which explains hemiplegia. However, it typically does not primarily affect the visual pathway.
  
- **Basilar artery**: Is part of the vertebrobasilar system and supplies the brainstem, cerebellum, and occipital lobe. However, occlusion here would more likely cause symptoms such as loss of consciousness, vertigo, and visual disturbances, not specifically hemiplegia and visual loss in the contralateral eye.

- **Anterior cerebral artery**: Supplies the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, including parts of the motor cortex, but it is less likely to cause hemiplegia and visual loss in the contralateral eye as its primary function is motor and some sensory functions.

- **Internal carotid artery**: Supplies the anterior two-thirds of the brain, including the occipital lobe, which is crucial for vision. Occlusion of the internal carotid artery can cause hemiplegia due to motor cortex involvement and visual loss due to visual pathway involvement.

Given the specific symptoms of hemiplegia and visual loss in the contralateral eye, the most likely cause is occlusion of the internal carotid artery.

   - **B. Essential Tremor**: Propranolol is actually used to treat essential tremor as it can help reduce tremors by decreasing the effects of adrenergic stimulation.
   - **C. Diabetes**: Beta-blockers can mask some symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which can be a concern for diabetic patients.
   - **D. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**: Propranolol is often used to treat SVT, as it can help slow down the heart rate and help terminate the episode.

3. **Identifying the Contradiction**: Among the options, the use of propranolol would be most concerning if the patient has a condition that could be worsened by its use or if its use is generally contraindicated. Given that propranolol can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, which is a significant concern for diabetic patients, this would be the most problematic scenario.

1. **Hemi mandibulectomy (A)**: This involves the removal of half of the mandible. Given that the patient is edentulous, this would likely result in significant functional and aesthetic deficits, especially since there is no tooth structure to preserve.

2. **Commando operation (B)**: This is a type of surgical procedure used for the resection of lesions in the mandible, but it is not a standard term in dental or oral surgery and lacks the precision needed for this specific case.

3. **Segmental mandiblectomy (C)**: This involves the removal of a segment of the mandible. While this can be precise, it might not be ideal for an edentulous patient as it may not adequately preserve the remaining bone structure that could be used for dental implants or other restorations.

4. **Marginal mandibulectomy (D)**: This procedure involves the removal of the bone margin while preserving as much of the mandible as possible. It is often used when the tumor is confined to the margin and does not involve the alveolar ridge or the bulk of the mandible. This approach can be more conservative and might provide better functional and aesthetic outcomes, especially for an edentulous patient.

Given the need to preserve as much of the mandible as possible for future restorations and the patient's edentulous state, the marginal mandibulectomy (D) is the most appropriate choice.

2299,Obstruction to the flow of CSF at the aqueduct of Sylvius will most likely lead to enlargement of -,"['All of the ventricles', 'Only lateral ventricle', 'Only fourth ventricle', 'Both lateral and third ventricles']","To solve this question, let's break down the process of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) flow and the anatomy involved.

1. **CSF Production and Flow**: CSF is produced primarily in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles and flows through the lateral ventricles, into the third ventricle, then through the aqueduct of Sylvius, into the fourth ventricle, and finally into the cisterns and subarachnoid space.

2. **Aqueduct of Sylvius**: This structure is a narrow channel between the third and fourth ventricles. Obstruction here can significantly affect the flow of CSF.

3. **Ventricular System**: The ventricular system includes the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle. Obstruction at the aqueduct of Sylvius affects the flow from the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle.

Given this information, obstruction at the aqueduct of Sylvius would primarily affect the flow from the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. This obstruction would lead to an accumulation of CSF in the third ventricle and the lateral ventricles, but not directly in the fourth ventricle or all ventricles simultaneously.

- **A. All of the ventricles**: This is not correct because the obstruction is specifically at the aqueduct of Sylvius, which primarily affects the third ventricle and lateral ventricles.
- **B. Only lateral ventricle**: This is not entirely correct because the obstruction affects the third ventricle as well.
- **C. Only fourth ventricle**: This is incorrect because the obstruction does not directly affect the fourth ventricle.

2302,"In the gr'cii circuit, the arc! flow pressure is 100 mm Hg and the outward flow pressure is 10 mm Hg. Each of the parallel circuit has a resistance of 5 mm Hg/mL/min. Calculate the flow across the circuit:","['45 mL', '90 mL', '3.6 mL', '135 mL']","To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the flow in a parallel circuit. The total flow (Q_total) in a parallel circuit can be calculated as the sum of the flows through each parallel branch. The flow through each branch can be calculated using Ohm's law for fluid dynamics, which states that the flow (Q) is equal to the pressure difference (ΔP) divided by the resistance (R).

For each branch:
\[ Q = \frac{\Delta P}{R} \]

Given:
- Arc flow pressure (ΔP_arc) = 100 mm Hg
- Outward flow pressure (ΔP_out) = 10 mm Hg
- Resistance (R) = 5 mm Hg/mL/min

First, calculate the flow through the arc branch:
\[ Q_{arc} = \frac{100 \text{ mm Hg}}{5 \text{ mm Hg/mL/min}} = 20 \text{ mL/min} \]

Next, calculate the flow through the outward branch:
\[ Q_{out} = \frac{10 \text{ mm Hg}}{5 \text{ mm Hg/mL/min}} = 2 \text{ mL/min} \]

Since these are parallel branches, the total flow is the sum of the individual flows:
\[ Q_{total} = Q_{arc} + Q_{out} = 20 \text{ mL/min} + 2 \text{ mL/min} = 22 \text{ mL/min} \]

None of the provided options match 22 mL/min exactly, but the closest option in the given choices is 135 mL, which seems to be a misinterpretation of the flow rate. Given the options, the closest reasonable answer based on the provided data and options is D.

A. Constitutional: This refers to a natural variation in growth patterns where a child grows at a normal rate but just at a slower pace than their peers. This is quite common and does not necessarily indicate a health problem.

B. Hypothyroidism: This condition can cause short stature due to reduced thyroid hormone levels affecting growth and metabolism, but it is not as common as constitutional growth variations.

C. Growth hormone deficiency: This is a specific condition where the body does not produce enough growth hormone, leading to slow growth and short stature. While it can cause short stature, it is relatively uncommon compared to constitutional growth patterns.

D. Systemic illness: Various systemic illnesses can affect growth, but they are not the most common cause of short stature. Typically, these conditions are associated with other symptoms and are less frequent as the primary cause.

Given these considerations, the most common cause of short stature is likely to be constitutional growth variations.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2500/mL with 80% bands. A WBC count this low with a high percentage of bands (immature cells) suggests severe leukopenia and a significant stress response, commonly seen in severe infections or sepsis.

3. **Imaging**: The chest radiograph is not provided, but the options need to be considered based on the clinical and laboratory findings.

- **A. Congenital syphilis**: While congenital syphilis can present with similar symptoms, it typically does not present with such a dramatic drop in WBC count or the presence of a large number of bands.
- **B. Diaphragmatic hernia**: This condition usually presents with respiratory distress and abdominal distension, but not the leukopenia and hypotension described.
- **C. Group B streptococcal (GBS) pneumonia**: This is a serious infection that can present with respiratory distress, hypothermia, and hypotension, and can also be associated with leukopenia and a high percentage of bands, which is consistent with a severe systemic infection.
- **D. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)**: TTN typically presents with tachypnea but usually does not cause such a dramatic leukopenia or hypotension.

A. Lactase deficiency: This condition leads to lactose malabsorption, which can cause osmotic diarrhea because lactose is not absorbed and remains in the intestine, drawing water into the lumen.

B. Ulcerative sprue: This is not a commonly used term in medicine. Sprue is typically associated with celiac disease, which is a malabsorption syndrome but not specifically an osmotic diarrhea condition.

C. Surreptitious ingestion of laxatives: This can cause osmotic diarrhea because the laxatives increase the osmotic load in the intestine, preventing water absorption.

D. Endocrine tumors: These can cause secretory diarrhea, where there is increased secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen, rather than osmotic diarrhea.

2314,Infant with cystic fibrosis (CF) are likely to develop,"['Meconium ileus', 'Loose motions', 'Vomiting', 'Constpation']","Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system due to a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

2. The CFTR gene defect leads to abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can block passages in the lungs and digestive tract.

3. Meconium ileus is a condition where the newborn's first stool, meconium, is abnormally thick and can cause intestinal blockage. This is a common complication in infants with CF.

4. Loose motions (diarrhea) can occur in CF but is not the primary or most characteristic symptom associated with meconium ileus.

5. Vomiting can occur in CF, but it is not the most specific symptom of meconium ileus.

6. Constipation is less likely in CF compared to other gastrointestinal issues, as the thick mucus typically causes obstruction rather than constipation.

2326,Senescent RBC's are mainly attacked in-,"['Vivax malaria', 'Ovale malaria', 'Falciparum malaria', 'Quartan malaria']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context of the question. Senescent RBCs, or red blood cells that are nearing the end of their life span, are often targeted by certain parasites, including those that cause malaria.

- **Vivax Malaria (A)**: This form of malaria causes relapses because of the presence of dormant forms of the parasite in the liver. It does not specifically target senescent RBCs.
- **Ovale Malaria (B)**: Similar to Vivax Malaria, it causes relapses and does not specifically target senescent RBCs.
- **Falciparum Malaria (C)**: This is the most severe form of malaria and is known to cause substantial destruction of RBCs, including senescent ones. The parasite multiplies within RBCs and causes them to rupture, leading to anemia. This process involves the destruction of both young and senescent RBCs.
- **Quartan Malaria (D)**: This is another form of malaria, but like Vivax and Ovale Malaria, it does not specifically target senescent RBCs.

Based on this analysis, the form of malaria that is known to target and destroy senescent RBCs is Falciparum Malaria.

- **VIPoma (Option D):** VIPomas (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptideomas) are typically found in the pancreas and are associated with increased production of vasoactive intestinal peptide.

Without the exact location marked, we can infer that the question likely refers to a tumor commonly found in the pancreas, which both Insulinoma and VIPoma are. However, VIPomas are more specifically linked to vasoactive intestinal peptide and are more commonly associated with the pancreas than Insulinomas.

2347,Ultrasound scanning of a fetus shows asymmetric growth retardation. It may be associated with the following pathology:,"['Anencephaly', 'Trisomy 18', 'Congenital rubella syndrome', 'Placenta pre']","Ultrasound findings of asymmetric growth retardation in a fetus are often associated with specific congenital anomalies or maternal-fetal conditions. Here's the reasoning for each option:

A. Anencephaly: This is a neural tube defect characterized by the absence of a major portion of the brain and skull. While it can cause growth restriction, it typically presents with symmetric growth restriction due to the extensive damage to the brain and cranium.

B. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome): This condition is associated with significant growth restriction and can present with both symmetric and asymmetric growth retardation. However, asymmetric growth retardation is more commonly seen in this condition.

C. Congenital rubella syndrome: This condition can cause growth restriction, but it is more commonly associated with symmetric growth restriction and other features such as cardiac defects, cataracts, and hearing loss.

D. Placenta previa: This condition involves the placenta partially or completely covering the cervix, which can lead to poor fetal growth due to decreased blood supply. However, placenta previa is more commonly associated with bleeding and other complications rather than asymmetric growth retardation.

The most likely association with asymmetric growth retardation is Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome).

2348,"All are impoant laboratory features of hereditary spherocytosis, EXCEPT:","['Reduced MCHC', 'Normocytic anemia', 'Positive pink test', 'Normal WBC count']","Let's analyze each option in the context of hereditary spherocytosis:

A. Reduced MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration) - This is a key feature of hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytes have a more spherical shape with a lower surface-to-volume ratio, leading to a reduced MCHC.

B. Normocytic anemia - Hereditary spherocytosis typically causes anemia, but the anemia is usually normocytic. This means the red blood cells are of normal size, distinguishing it from other types of anemia.

C. Positive pink test - This test is used to detect the presence of spherocytes in the blood. A positive result indicates the presence of spherocytes, which is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.

D. Normal WBC count - Hereditary spherocytosis does not affect the white blood cell count, which remains normal.

The exception here is the normal WBC count, as the other features are indeed important laboratory findings in hereditary spherocytosis.

2349,Treatment of choice of small preputial Penile carcinoma is,"['Total Penectomy', 'Partial Penectomy', 'Wide excision', 'Emasculation']","To determine the correct treatment for small preputial penile carcinoma, we need to consider the principles of oncological surgery. The goal is to remove the tumor completely while preserving as much of the penis as possible, which typically means excising the cancerous tissue with adequate margins to ensure all cancer cells are removed.

- Total Penectomy involves removing the entire penis, which is an extensive and disfiguring procedure that is not the first choice for small tumors.
- Partial Penectomy removes only a part of the penis, which might be considered if the tumor is confined to a specific area and preservation of the penis is critical.
- Wide excision is the removal of the tumor along with a wider margin of normal tissue around the tumor to ensure complete removal of cancer cells. This is a common approach for small, localized penile carcinomas.
- Emasculation, or castration, is a procedure used for hormone-sensitive tumors and is not typically a primary treatment for penile carcinoma.

Given these considerations, the treatment of choice for small preputial penile carcinoma is wide excision, as it allows for complete removal of the tumor with a margin of normal tissue.
