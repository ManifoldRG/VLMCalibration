It is appears that a small thrombus embolized during surgery and lodged in the aery supplying the optic nerve. Which aery would be blocked?","['Central aery of the retina', 'Infraorbital aery', 'Lacrimal aery', 'Nasociliary aretry']","To determine which artery would be blocked, we need to consider the blood supply to the optic nerve. The optic nerve receives its blood supply primarily from the short posterior ciliary arteries, which are branches of the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery.

The central artery of the retina (Option A) is a branch of the ophthalmic artery, but it supplies the inner layers of the retina, not the optic nerve itself. 

The infraorbital artery (Option B) is a branch of the maxillary artery, which is a terminal branch of the external carotid artery, not the internal carotid artery. Therefore, it is not directly related to the supply of the optic nerve.

The lacrimal artery (Option C) is also a branch of the ophthalmic artery, but it primarily supplies the lacrimal gland and the surrounding conjunctiva.

The nasociliary artery (Option D) is a branch of the ophthalmic artery, and it gives off small branches that supply the optic nerve, including the short posterior ciliary arteries.

Given that the blockage of the artery supplying the optic nerve is due to an embolus from the carotid artery, the correct answer is the artery that is most directly related to the supply of the optic nerve, which is the nasociliary artery.

27,Growth hormone has its effect on growth through?,"['Directly', 'IG1-1', 'Thyroxine', 'Intranuclear receptors']","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding Growth Hormone's Role**: Growth hormone (GH) is secreted by the pituitary gland and plays a crucial role in growth, body composition, cell repair, and metabolism. Its effects on growth are primarily mediated through the stimulation of the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).

2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A. Directly**: While GH does have some direct effects on cells, its primary mechanism of action for promoting growth is not direct but rather through the stimulation of IGF-1 production.
   - **B. IG1-1 (IGF-1)**: This is the correct mechanism. GH stimulates the liver and other tissues to produce IGF-1, which then mediates many of the growth-promoting effects of GH.
   - **C. Thyroxine**: Thyroxine, a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, can influence growth indirectly but is not the primary mediator of GH's effects on growth.
   - **D. Intranuclear receptors**: GH does not primarily act through intranuclear receptors to exert its growth-promoting effects. Instead, its effects are mediated through the IGF-1 pathway.

3. **Conclusion**: Given the information above, the correct answer is the one that reflects the primary mechanism by which growth hormone affects growth.

1. Hirsutism affects approximately 25% of women. This is a true statement. Hirsutism is a common endocrine disorder that affects around 5-10% of women of reproductive age, but the prevalence can vary depending on the population and criteria used for diagnosis. However, stating it affects ""approximately 25% of women"" is an overestimation.

2. Virilization refers to a condition in which androgen levels are sufficiently high to cause additional signs and symptoms. This is a true statement. Virilization is characterized by the development of male secondary sexual characteristics due to elevated androgen levels.

3. Frequently, patients with growth hormone excess (i.e., acromegaly) present with hirsutism. This is a false statement. While acromegaly can lead to various physical changes and symptoms, hirsutism is not a characteristic feature of the condition. Acromegaly primarily affects the growth of bones and organs due to excess growth hormone.

4. A simple and commonly used method to grade hair growth is the modified scale of Ferriman and Gallwey. This is a true statement. The modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score is a widely used tool for assessing and grading hirsutism based on the presence and severity of excessive hair growth in different body areas.

5. Scores above 8 suggest excess androgen-mediated hair growth. This is a true statement. According to the Ferriman-Gallwey scale, a score above 8 indicates the presence of hirsutism.

46,In chronic alcoholism the rate limiting component for alcohol metabolism excluding enzymes is/are : (PGI Dec 2008),"['NADP', 'NAD+', 'NADPH', 'FADH']","The correct answer is B.

In chronic alcoholism, the primary enzyme responsible for alcohol metabolism is alcohol dehydrogenase, which converts ethanol into acetaldehyde using NAD+ as a cofactor. The rate-limiting step in this process is the availability of NAD+, which is reduced during chronic alcohol consumption. The reduced NAD+ is then recycled back to its oxidized form by the enzyme NAD+ kinase.

Therefore, the rate-limiting component for alcohol metabolism, excluding enzymes, is the availability of NAD+, making option B the correct answer.

Leg and perineus', 'Left face', 'Right face', 'Right shoulder & trunk']","To answer this question, we need to understand the motor cortex and its association with motor function. The motor cortex is responsible for controlling voluntary movements of the body. It is organized in a somatotopic manner, meaning that different areas of the cortex control different parts of the body.

The paracentral lobule is a region in the medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere that is involved in the control of the lower limbs. It is located near the central sulcus and is associated with the motor and sensory representation of the lower limbs.

When the left paracentral lobule is injured during surgery for a meningioma, it would likely affect the motor function of the left lower limb. However, since the motor cortex is crossed, meaning that the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, the injury to the left paracentral lobule would lead to weakness (paresis) of the right leg and perineum.

The Bolton ratio is calculated by comparing the sum of the mesio-distal widths of the maxillary teeth to the sum of the mesio-distal widths of the mandibular teeth. A ratio of 80-90% is considered normal.

However, the classification of malocclusions (Class 1, Class 2, Class 3) does not directly relate to the Bolton ratio, but rather to the type of malocclusion:

- Class 1: The incisors are normally positioned, but there may be issues with overbite or underbite.
- Class 2: The upper incisors protrude beyond the lower incisors, often resulting in an increased overbite.
- Class 3: The lower incisors protrude beyond the upper incisors, often resulting in an increased underbite.

Given the description of excessive interarch space, this would likely be related to a Class 2 malocclusion, where the upper teeth are more protrusive than the lower teeth, potentially leading to an increased space between the arches.

78,Delayed union of fracture of a bone follo-wing a surgical treatment may be due to,"['Infection', 'Inadequate circulation', 'Inadequate mobilization', 'All of the above']","To address this question, let's consider the potential factors that can contribute to delayed union of a fracture following surgical treatment.

A. Infection: Infection can indeed hinder the healing process of a fracture. Bacterial infection can cause inflammation, damage tissue, and interfere with the body's natural healing processes, leading to delayed union.

B. Inadequate circulation: Circulation plays a crucial role in the healing process of a fracture. Adequate blood supply is necessary for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the fracture site, which are essential for the healing process. Inadequate circulation can lead to delayed healing or even nonunion.

C. Inadequate mobilization: While immobilization is often necessary for a period after a fracture to allow proper healing, inadequate mobilization after the initial healing phase can lead to stiffness and reduced bone density, contributing to delayed union.

Given the explanations above, all three factors (A, B, C) can contribute to delayed union of a fracture following surgical treatment.

The best position for the patient immediately after the incident is","['To position the patient upright', 'To position the patients in a semi inclined posture to visualize the perforation', 'Trendelenberg position', 'Reverse trendelenberg position']","To manage a patient who has suspected an instrument (in this case, the mesio buccal root of an upper first molar) has been pushed into the maxillary sinus, the primary concern is to prevent the instrument from causing further damage or becoming dislodged and entering the intracranial space through the cribriform plate, which is a thin bony structure that separates the nasal cavity from the cranial cavity.

The most appropriate position for the patient immediately after the incident is to prevent any further downward displacement of the instrument into the maxillary sinus. Therefore, positioning the patient in a way that counters any downward force on the sinus is ideal.

Given the anatomy and the position of the maxillary sinus relative to the nasal cavity, the best position to prevent further downward displacement of the instrument would be to position the patient in an upright position. This would help to prevent the instrument from moving further into the maxillary sinus.

80,"All of the following statements are true regarding hyperophy, except:","['Occurs due to synthesis and assembly of additional intracellular components.', 'There is an increase in the size of the cells.', 'Cells capable of division respond to stress by hyperophy and hyperplasia.', 'There is an increase in the number of cells.']","To address this question, we need to understand the definitions of hypertrophy and hyperplasia, as these terms are often confused or used interchangeably but have distinct meanings in the context of cell biology and physiology.

Hypertrophy refers to the increase in the size of cells, which is often a response to increased workload or demand for a particular cell type. This increase in size can be due to the synthesis and assembly of additional intracellular components, such as proteins, which contribute to the expansion of the cell. This process is typical in muscle cells, for example, where hypertrophy is seen in response to increased resistance training.

Hyperplasia, on the other hand, is an increase in the number of cells, which is a different response to cell stress. This process involves the division of cells, leading to an increase in the total number of cells. Hyperplasia is a characteristic feature of many tissues, including the skin, bones, and the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, which can proliferate in response to injury or growth factors.

Considering these definitions, let's evaluate the options provided:

A. Occurs due to synthesis and assembly of additional intracellular components. - This is true for hypertrophy, as it involves the production of more intracellular components to increase the cell's size.

B. There is an increase in the size of the cells. - This is a true statement regarding hypertrophy, as hypertrophy by definition involves cells becoming larger.

C. Cells capable of division respond to stress by hypertrophy and hyperplasia. - This statement is accurate. Cells that are capable of dividing can respond to stress by either hypertrophy (increasing in size) or hyperplasia (increasing in number), depending on the stimulus and the type of cell.

D. There is an increase in the number of cells. - This is a true statement regarding hyperplasia, as it involves an increase in the number of cells through cell division.

Given the explanations above, all statements (A, B, C, and D) are true regarding hypertrophy and hyperplasia, but they describe different aspects of cell adaptation. However, the question asks for the exception, which seems to be based on the implication that one of the statements might not be as directly associated with hypertrophy as the others. Since all the options directly relate to hypertrophy or hyperplasia, and all the statements provided are technically true and relevant to either hypertrophy or hyperplasia, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the question as it's presented.

A. **Monotherapy for acute episodes**: Lithium is often used as a monotherapy for the treatment of acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder. It's particularly useful for preventing or reducing the severity of manic episodes. Therefore, this statement is true.

B. **Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment**: Monitoring of serum lithium levels is crucial for guiding dose adjustments. Serum levels should be regularly checked to ensure they remain within a therapeutic range (typically between 0.6 and 1.2 mmol/L) to minimize the risk of toxicity while maximizing therapeutic effects. This statement is false.

C. **Can result in leucocytosis**: Lithium can indeed cause changes in the white blood cell count, but it more commonly causes leucopenia (a decrease in the white blood cell count) rather than leucocytosis (an increase). Leucopenia is a known side effect of lithium, although it is often not a major concern. This statement is misleading or incorrect in the context of typical lithium effects.

D. **Can result in hyperthyroidism on long term use**: Lithium can interfere with thyroid function, leading to hypothyroidism (not hyperthyroidism) more frequently than hyperthyroidism. This effect is due to lithium's impact on thyroid hormone production and the thyroid gland's ability to regulate hormone levels. Therefore, this statement is false.

83,What is the pressure of inspiration?,"['Intrapleuarl', 'Transpulmonary', 'Trans chest wall', 'Alveolar pressure']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the pressure of inspiration:

A. Intrapleural: During inspiration, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, which decreases the pressure inside the pleural space (intrapleural pressure) compared to the atmosphere. This decrease in pressure allows air to flow into the lungs. Therefore, intrapleural pressure is the pressure of inspiration.

B. Transpulmonary: This option refers to the pressure difference across the lungs, from the inside to the outside. While transpulmonary pressure is important for understanding lung mechanics, it is not directly the pressure of inspiration.

C. Trans chest wall: This refers to the pressure difference across the chest wall, from the inside to the outside. Like transpulmonary pressure, it is an important concept in respiratory physiology but not the direct pressure of inspiration.

D. Alveolar pressure: During inspiration, alveolar pressure is decreased, but it is not the driving force for inspiration. The decrease in intrapleural pressure is what allows air to flow into the lungs.

85,Fever associated with infection,"['Accelerates bacterial and viral replication', 'Left shifts the oxygen dissociation curve', 'Is due to interleukin-1 released from CD4 T-helper cells', 'Increase oxygen release to tissue']","Fever is a common symptom of infection, and it's caused by the release of pyrogens, which are substances that raise the body temperature. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a type of pyrogen released by macrophages, not CD4 T-helper cells. CD4 T-helper cells are a type of immune cell that plays a role in initiating the immune response, but they are not directly responsible for releasing IL-1.

The correct answer is C, but only because it is a bit more accurate. However, the primary cytokine responsible for fever is actually Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) which is released by macrophages and other immune cells. CD4 T-helper cells can indirectly contribute to fever by producing other cytokines that stimulate the release of IL-1β from macrophages.

That being said, the most accurate answer is actually A. Fever is known to accelerate the replication of certain bacteria, making option A the correct answer.

103,Which of the following is not false about annual risk of TB,"['ARI of 1% = 75 new cases', 'Current ARI in India is 1.7%', 'It is represents new cases of TB', 'It is assessed by tuberculin conversion in previously non-vaccinated children']","To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option regarding the annual risk of TB (ARI):

A. ARI of 1% = 75 new cases: This statement is not false. The annual risk of TB is a measure of the number of new TB cases that occur in a population over a one-year period. A 1% ARI would indeed correspond to approximately 75 new cases, assuming a population of 7,500 (1% of 7,500 = 75).

B. Current ARI in India is 1.7%: This statement is not false. The annual risk of TB (ARI) in India is reported to be approximately 1.7%, indicating a significant burden of TB in the country.

C. It is represents new cases of TB: This statement is true and not false. The ARI indeed represents new cases of TB, making it a measure of the incidence of TB.

D. It is assessed by tuberculin conversion in previously non-vaccinated children: This statement is not true. Tuberculin conversion is a method used to assess exposure to TB, but it is not the primary method for assessing the ARI. ARI is typically estimated using surveillance data on reported cases of TB, which may include both new and previously treated cases. The use of tuberculin conversion in children might be relevant for assessing exposure to TB, especially in areas with high TB prevalence or in specific epidemiological studies, but it is not the standard approach for calculating the ARI.

104,IgA deposits on skin biopsy,"['Henoch Schouleiln puspura', 'Giant cell aeritis', 'Microscopic polyangitis', ""Wegener's granulomatosis""]","To answer this question, we need to consider the conditions that are associated with IgA deposits on skin biopsy.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis that is characterized by IgA deposits in the skin, among other tissues. It typically presents with palpable purpura, abdominal pain, joint pain, and kidney involvement.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a large vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the branches of the external carotid artery. It is not typically associated with IgA deposits.

Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a small vessel vasculitis that is characterized by the presence of pauci-immune necrotizing vasculitis, with or without the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). It is not typically associated with IgA deposits.

Wegener's granulomatosis (now referred to as granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is a small vessel vasculitis that is characterized by the presence of necrotizing granulomas and vasculitis. It is also associated with ANCA. Like MPA, it is not typically associated with IgA deposits.

Given this information, the correct answer is the condition that is most closely associated with IgA deposits on skin biopsy.

106,Which of the following hormonal activity is expected immediately prior to Ovulation?,"['LH surge', 'FSH surge', 'Progestrone surge', 'Estrogen surge']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the menstrual cycle and the role of different hormones.

In the menstrual cycle, the follicular phase is dominated by the hormone estrogen, which causes the growth and thickening of the uterine lining. Estrogen levels typically rise throughout the follicular phase, peaking just before ovulation.

Around the time of ovulation, a surge in the luteinizing hormone (LH) occurs. This LH surge triggers the release of the egg from the ovary and prepares the uterus for potential implantation of a fertilized egg.

Progesterone levels typically rise after ovulation, when the empty follicle in the ovary secretes this hormone. Estrogen levels may also decrease after ovulation, as the follicle that produced estrogen is now empty.

Considering this information:

* A. LH surge: This is the correct answer. The LH surge is a characteristic hormonal event that occurs immediately prior to ovulation.
* B. FSH surge: FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) levels typically rise at the beginning of the menstrual cycle to stimulate follicle growth, but they do not surge immediately prior to ovulation.
* C. Progesterone surge: Progesterone levels typically rise after ovulation, not immediately prior.
* D. Estrogen surge: While estrogen levels do rise during the follicular phase, the surge in estrogen is not as pronounced or as directly related to ovulation as the LH surge.

107,"Which of the following disease with bird, ahropod and human chain","['Malaria', 'Japanese encephalitis', 'Paragonimus', 'Plague']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in terms of the vector involved and its relationship to the disease:

A. Malaria - This disease is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. So, the chain involves mosquito, human, and bird (as the parasite has a bird reservoir).

B. Japanese Encephalitis - This disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito, which feeds on the blood of infected birds. Thus, the chain involves mosquito, bird, and human.

C. Paragonimus - This parasitic lung infection is acquired by eating raw or undercooked infected crustaceans or, occasionally, through direct contact with contaminated water. The definitive host is a mammal, but the first intermediate host is a freshwater snail, and the second intermediate host is a crustacean. Humans are the final host, but birds are not typically part of this chain.

D. Plague - This disease is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas that live on rodents. While fleas are a crucial component of the transmission cycle, birds are not a primary host or part of the main transmission chain.

Considering the question, the best match for a disease with a bird, arthropod (vector), and human chain is Japanese Encephalitis.

108,A Dentin 'Primer'?,"['Etches the dentin', 'It increases the surface energy & wets the dentin surface', 'Removes the smear layer', 'Conditions the dentin']","To answer this question, let's break down the function of a ""Dentin Primer"" in dentistry.

A ""Dentin Primer"" is a material used to prepare the dentin surface for the placement of dental restorations, such as composite resins. The primary purpose of a primer is to enhance the bonding between the restoration material and the dentin.

Option A: ""Etches the dentin"" - While etching is indeed a step in the bonding process, it is typically performed using a separate etchant, such as phosphoric acid. The etchant creates micro-retentions on the dentin surface, allowing the primer and restorative material to better adhere. However, the primary function of a primer is not to etch the dentin.

Option B: ""It increases the surface energy & wets the dentin surface"" - This is the primary function of a dentin primer. By increasing the surface energy of the dentin, the primer allows the restorative material to better wet and bond with the dentin surface. This results in a stronger bond between the restoration and the tooth.

Option C: ""Removes the smear layer"" - The smear layer is a layer of debris that forms on the dentin surface during drilling or other dental procedures. While removing the smear layer can be beneficial for bonding, it is not the primary function of a dentin primer.

Option D: ""Conditions the dentin"" - Conditioning the dentin refers to the process of preparing the dentin surface for bonding, which can include etching, cleaning, and other steps. While a primer does condition the dentin to some extent, it is specifically designed to increase the surface energy and wettability of the dentin surface.

109,Potter syndrome is not assoiated with,"['Bilateral renal agenesis', 'Bilateral multicystic kidney disease', 'oligohydromnios', 'Polyhydromnios']","To answer this question, let's consider what Potter syndrome is and its associated characteristics.

Potter syndrome, also known as Potter sequence, is a rare condition that occurs when a baby is born without kidneys or with severely underdeveloped kidneys. This condition can be associated with various renal anomalies, but the key characteristic is the absence or severe underdevelopment of the kidneys.

Considering the options:

A. Bilateral renal agenesis - This is a condition where both kidneys fail to develop or are absent. This is indeed associated with Potter syndrome.

B. Bilateral multicystic kidney disease - This condition is characterized by cysts in both kidneys, which can be seen in various forms of renal disease but is not typically associated with Potter syndrome.

C. Oligohydramnios - This condition refers to a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy. It can be a consequence of Potter syndrome due to the kidneys' inability to produce urine, which is a significant contributor to the volume of amniotic fluid.

D. Polyhydramnios - This condition is characterized by an excessive amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy. Polyhydramnios is not typically associated with Potter syndrome; instead, oligohydramnios is more commonly linked to the condition.

Given the above information, the correct answer is B because bilateral multicystic kidney disease is not a characteristic typically associated with Potter syndrome.

111,Increase in pauwel's angle indicate,"['Good prognosis', 'Impaction', 'More chances of displacement', 'Trabecular alignment displacement']","To answer this question, we need to consider the concept of Pauwel's angle, which is used in orthopedics to describe the angle of the femur in relation to the pelvis in cases of femoral neck fractures.

Pauwel's angle is the angle between the femur and the horizontal plane in which the fracture line is situated. It is classified into three types: Type I (less than 30°), Type II (30°-50°), and Type III (greater than 50°).

A Type I fracture has a good prognosis because the angle is small and the bone is more likely to heal.

A Type III fracture, on the other hand, has a larger Pauwel's angle, which indicates that the bone fragment is more displaced and the fracture is more unstable. This makes it more likely to displace further.

Considering the options:

A. Good prognosis - This is more likely to be associated with a smaller Pauwel's angle (Type I).

B. Impaction - While impaction can occur in any fracture, it's not directly related to Pauwel's angle.

C. More chances of displacement - This is more likely to be associated with a larger Pauwel's angle (Type III).

D. Trabecular alignment displacement - This is a general consequence of any fracture, but it doesn't directly relate to Pauwel's angle.

119,Relining of complete denture is not indicated when,"['Denture contains broken teeth', 'There is excessive resorption of the ridge', 'Vertical dimension is excessively reduced and has to be changed', 'Centric relation does not coincide with centric occlusion']","Relining of a complete denture involves re-lining the denture with a new base material to better fit the changed contours of the gums and jawbone. However, this process is not suitable in certain situations where more extensive or significant changes are needed.

Option B, ""There is excessive resorption of the ridge,"" might seem like a reason not to reline, but excessive resorption does indeed require relining to accommodate the new ridge shape. 

Option C, ""Vertical dimension is excessively reduced and has to be changed,"" suggests a need for a different approach, as relining the denture base won't correct the vertical dimension.

Option D, ""Centric relation does not coincide with centric occlusion,"" is a situation that typically requires adjustments to the occlusion (the way the upper and lower teeth fit together), not just a relining.

Option A, ""Denture contains broken teeth,"" is not necessarily a contraindication for relining. Broken teeth can often be repaired or replaced without needing a full denture remake or rebase.

The situation that most clearly indicates that relining is not indicated is when the vertical dimension needs to be changed, as this would require a more extensive procedure such as rebasing or remaking the denture.

123,Which of the following is the main enzyme responsible for activation of xenobiotics?,"['Cytochrome P-450', 'Glucuronyl transferase', 'Glutathione S-transferase', 'NADPH cytochrome P-450-reductase']","To answer this question, let's consider the role of each enzyme in the context of xenobiotic activation.

Xenobiotics are foreign substances that can be harmful to the body. The process of activating xenobiotics refers to the metabolic transformation of these substances into more reactive or toxic forms, which can then be eliminated from the body.

A. Cytochrome P-450 is a family of enzymes that play a crucial role in the metabolism of xenobiotics. Specifically, they are involved in the phase I metabolism of xenobiotics, where they convert these substances into more reactive intermediates. This process is often referred to as ""activation"" because it makes the xenobiotic more susceptible to further metabolism or conjugation reactions.

B. Glucuronyl transferase is an enzyme involved in the phase II metabolism of xenobiotics. It conjugates glucuronic acid to the xenobiotic, making it more water-soluble and easier to eliminate from the body. This is an example of ""inactivation"" rather than activation.

C. Glutathione S-transferase is another enzyme involved in the phase II metabolism of xenobiotics. It conjugates glutathione to the xenobiotic, making it more water-soluble and easier to eliminate from the body. Like glucuronyl transferase, this is an example of inactivation rather than activation.

D. NADPH cytochrome P-450-reductase is a flavoprotein that provides the necessary electrons for the cytochrome P-450 enzymes to function. While it is involved in the activation of xenobiotics, it is not the main enzyme responsible for this process.

Considering the roles of these enzymes, the correct answer is the one that is directly involved in the activation of xenobiotics.

A. Total Leukocyte count 4000-100,000: While a very high leukocyte count (over 100,000) can be associated with a poor prognosis, the range of 4000-100,000 is quite broad and does not specifically indicate a poor prognostic factor. The prognostic significance of the leukocyte count is more nuanced than a specific number, often requiring context such as the patient's symptoms, overall health, and response to treatment.

B. Age < 2 years: Age is indeed a factor in the prognosis of childhood ALL. However, being under 2 years old is generally considered a favorable prognostic factor, not a poor one. Young children tend to have a better response to treatment and higher cure rates than older children.

C. Testicular involvement: Testicular involvement in childhood ALL is a significant adverse risk factor. It indicates that the leukemia has spread to the testes, a location outside the bone marrow, which complicates treatment and can lead to a poorer prognosis.

D. Blasts in peripheral smear: The presence of blasts in a peripheral smear indicates leukemia, but the mere presence of blasts does not inherently denote a poor prognosis. The diagnosis of ALL is typically confirmed by the presence of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, but this is more of a diagnostic criterion than a prognostic indicator.

Considering the options, testicular involvement (C) is the clear poor prognostic factor for childhood ALL.

A. Affected sibling is a risk factor: This is true. Having a family history, including a first-degree relative (parent, child, or sibling) diagnosed with breast cancer, increases a person's risk of developing breast cancer.

B. Paget's disease of nipple is intraductal type of CA: This is also true. Paget's disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer that primarily affects the skin of the nipple and, sometimes, the areola. It is often associated with an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer, making it an intraductal type of cancer in the context of its association with underlying intraductal lesions.

C. Common in aged nulliparous: This is true. Women who have never given birth (nulliparous) or have their first child at an older age (more than 35 years) have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer compared to women who have given birth at a younger age.

D. Increased incidence with prolonged breast feeding: This is false. Actually, the opposite is true. Breastfeeding has been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. The longer a woman breastfeeds, the lower her risk of developing breast cancer. This is thought to be due to the hormonal changes and the removal of the milk-producing cells in the breast, which may reduce the number of cells at risk for becoming cancerous.

1. **Cholestyramine (A)**: This is a bile acid sequestrant that can bind digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing its absorption. Therefore, it can interact with digoxin.

2. **Thiazide diuretics (B)**: These diuretics can increase serum potassium levels. However, digoxin toxicity can be exacerbated by hypokalemia (low potassium levels), which can be worsened by thiazide diuretics. Therefore, they do interact with digoxin.

3. **Quinidine (C)**: Quinidine can increase digoxin levels by reducing its clearance. It also has the potential to cause digoxin toxicity by increasing the drug's effect on the heart. So, quinidine does interact with digoxin.

4. **Amlodipine (D)**: Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used primarily for hypertension and angina. Unlike the other options, it does not significantly interact with digoxin's pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in a manner that would necessitate avoidance or dose adjustment due to the drug interaction.

137,Secondary retention for a removable partial denture is provided by,"['The indirect retainer', 'The direct retainer', 'Intimate contact between the denture bases and the underlying tissues', 'Direct and indirect retainers']","To answer this question, let's break down the options related to removable partial dentures (RPDs) and their retention mechanisms.

1. **Direct Retainer (B)**: This is the primary means of retention for a removable partial denture, which is typically achieved through clasps or attachments that directly engage the remaining teeth. However, the question asks about **secondary retention**, which implies an additional mechanism to help stabilize the denture.

2. **Indirect Retainer (A)**: The indirect retainer is a mechanism that helps to prevent the denture from rotating or tilting away from the tissues. It's crucial for maintaining the denture in place but is generally considered secondary to the direct retainer in terms of primary retention.

3. **Intimate Contact Between the Denture Bases and the Underlying Tissues (C)**: This refers to the pressure of the denture bases against the mucosa (the oral mucous membrane), which provides some degree of retention. It's a passive mechanism that helps to keep the denture in place but is considered secondary compared to the direct and indirect retainers.

4. **Direct and Indirect Retainers (D)**: This option combines both primary and secondary retention mechanisms, which could be misleading as the question asks specifically for secondary retention.

Given the options and understanding the definitions, the best answer for **secondary retention** would be the mechanism that provides additional support or stabilization to the denture once the primary retention (direct retainer) has been engaged.

174,Which of the following ultrasound finding has the highest association with aneuploidy?,"['Choroid plexus cyst', 'Nuchal translucency', 'Cystic hygroma', 'Single umbilical aery']","To determine the correct answer, let's examine the options one by one in terms of their association with aneuploidy, which is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, often leading to genetic disorders.

A. Choroid plexus cysts are relatively common findings in ultrasound evaluations during pregnancy. While they can be associated with aneuploidy, particularly trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), they are also seen in a significant proportion of normal pregnancies, making them less specific for aneuploidy.

B. Nuchal translucency (NT) is the sonographic appearance of the area at the back of the fetus's neck. An increased NT thickness is often associated with aneuploidy, particularly Down syndrome (trisomy 21). However, a thickened NT can also be due to other factors such as fetal anomalies or maternal conditions.

C. Cystic hygroma is a fluid-filled sac in the neck of the fetus, often detected during a routine ultrasound. It is a strong marker for aneuploidy, particularly Turner syndrome (45,X), but it can also be seen in cases of trisomy 21 and 18. The presence of a cystic hygroma significantly increases the risk of aneuploidy, making it a critical finding for further evaluation.

D. Single umbilical artery (SUA) is a congenital anomaly that can be detected during an ultrasound. While it may be associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy and other fetal anomalies, it is not as strongly associated with aneuploidy as some of the other options.

Given the above considerations, the option that has the highest association with aneuploidy is C. Cystic hygroma. This is because a cystic hygroma is a very strong marker for aneuploidy, particularly Turner syndrome, and is often used as a marker for further genetic testing.

175,Which of the following is released from hypothalamus?,"['Orexin', 'Cortisol releasing hormone', 'Neuropeptide', 'Ghrelin']","To answer this question, we need to consider what is released from the hypothalamus.

The hypothalamus is a region of the brain that plays a crucial role in hormone production and helps to stimulate many important processes in the body, including hormone production in the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus is responsible for releasing several hormones, including:

- Orexin (also known as hypocretin) is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Orexin is indeed produced in the hypothalamus.

- Cortisol releasing hormone (also known as corticotropin-releasing hormone, CRH) is indeed a hormone produced by the hypothalamus, but it is specifically involved in the release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex.

- Neuropeptide is a broad category of signaling molecules that are involved in the transmission of signals within the nervous system. While many neuropeptides are released from the hypothalamus, this answer is too broad to be correct.

- Ghrelin is a hormone that is produced in the gastrointestinal tract and is involved in the regulation of appetite and food intake. While ghrelin is not typically associated with the hypothalamus, the brain, including the hypothalamus, does play a role in the regulation of ghrelin levels.

176,An athelete presented with red coloured urine after 2 days of history of severe exeion. The most probable cause is?,"['Hemoglobinuria', 'Hemosiderinuria', 'Hematuria', 'Myoglobinuria']","After analyzing the scenario, I would reason that the athlete's presentation of red-colored urine after severe exercise is most consistent with myoglobinuria. Here's my thought process:

1. **Severe exercise** is a known trigger for rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle tissue breaks down rapidly.
2. **Myoglobin** is a protein found in muscles that is released into the bloodstream when muscle damage occurs. When the kidneys filter myoglobin from the blood, it can be excreted in the urine, causing it to appear red or cola-colored.
3. **Hemoglobinuria** (A) is the presence of hemoglobin in the urine, typically seen in conditions like hemolytic anemia. However, it wouldn't be directly linked to severe exercise.
4. **Hemosiderinuria** (B) refers to the presence of hemosiderin (a protein that stores iron) in the urine, often seen in conditions like kidney damage or hemolytic anemia. While it can cause urine to appear dark, it's less likely related to severe exercise.
5. **Hematuria** (C) is the presence of blood in the urine, which can be caused by various conditions, including kidney stones, infections, or cancer. However, it's not the most likely explanation for red urine after severe exercise.

Given the athlete's history of severe exercise and the timing of the red-colored urine, I believe the most probable cause is **myoglobinuria** (D).

The VOR is a reflex that helps maintain clear vision during head movements. It's responsible for stabilizing images on the retina, allowing us to see smoothly and steadily even when our head is moving.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. Flocculonodular Lobe: This part of the cerebellum is indeed involved in the regulation of eye movements, including the VOR. It receives input from the vestibular system (which senses head movements) and sends output to the oculomotor muscles, helping to stabilize the eyes during head movements.

B. Vermal portion of Spinocerebellum: The vermis is part of the spinocerebellum and is primarily involved in coordinating body movements, not directly related to the VOR.

C. Neocerebellum: The neocerebellum is involved in coordinating voluntary movements, such as those of the limbs, and is not primarily related to the VOR.

D. Paravermal region of Spinocerebellum: This region is also involved in coordinating body movements, particularly those related to the limbs, and is not directly related to the VOR.

Given the options, the correct answer is related to the part of the cerebellum responsible for eye movement regulation, specifically the VOR.

182,Which test helps to differentiate between concomitant squint and paralytic squint,"['Cover - uncover test', 'Alternate covertest', 'Direct cover test', 'None of the above']","To differentiate between concomitant squint and paralytic squint, the test that helps is the one that assesses the alignment of the eyes in different directions of gaze.

Concomitant squint is a type of strabismus where the angle of deviation remains the same in all directions of gaze. Paralytic squint, on the other hand, is caused by paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles, leading to varying angles of deviation in different directions of gaze.

The alternate cover test (Option B) is the most suitable test for this purpose. This test involves alternately covering each eye to assess the movement of the eyes. In concomitant squint, the angle of deviation remains the same, and the eyes will move equally in all directions of gaze when uncovered. In paralytic squint, the angle of deviation varies in different directions of gaze, and the eyes will move differently when uncovered.

The other options are not the best choice for this purpose:

* The cover-uncover test (Option A) is primarily used to detect the presence of squint, but it does not help differentiate between concomitant and paralytic squint.
* The direct cover test (Option C) is used to assess the movement of the eye being covered, but it does not provide information about the angle of deviation in different directions of gaze.

A. HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography) is a sophisticated imaging technique that provides detailed cross-sectional images of the body. While it can be useful for detecting structural abnormalities, it may not be the most sensitive or specific for assessing the function and blood flow in renal arteries, which is crucial for diagnosing renovascular hypertension.

B. CT Angiography (CTA) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses contrast dye to visualize the blood vessels, including the renal arteries. It is highly sensitive and specific for detecting stenosis (narrowing) or other abnormalities in the renal arteries, making it an excellent choice for diagnosing renovascular hypertension.

C. Captopril-enhanced radionucleotide scan involves administering captopril (an ACE inhibitor) and a small amount of radioactive material to the patient. The radioactive material accumulates in the kidney, and its distribution is measured. Captopril can reduce blood flow to the kidney if there is a stenosis, leading to a decrease in the uptake of the radioactive material. While this test can provide information on renal function and the effects of captopril on the kidneys, it may not be as sensitive or specific as other imaging modalities for directly visualizing the renal arteries.

D. Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries can evaluate blood flow in the renal arteries and is non-invasive. It can detect stenosis, but its sensitivity and specificity may vary depending on the operator's skill level and the patient's body habitus.

Considering the options, CT Angiography (B) stands out as the most specific and sensitive screening test for renovascular hypertension due to its high accuracy for detecting abnormalities in the renal arteries.

192,Usually associated with parvovirus B19 infection in those with hereditary spherocytosis-,"['Mild to moderate splenomegaly', 'Aplastic crisis', 'Gallstones', 'Hemolytic crisis']","In individuals with hereditary spherocytosis, parvovirus B19 infection can lead to a significant impact on the production of red blood cells. Given the nature of hereditary spherocytosis, which involves a genetic defect that affects the production of spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, or protein 4.2, essential for red blood cell membrane integrity, the body's ability to produce new red blood cells is impaired.

When parvovirus B19 infects the bone marrow, it can temporarily halt erythropoiesis, the process by which red blood cells are produced. This leads to a severe reduction in the production of new red blood cells, which can be particularly problematic for individuals with hereditary spherocytosis because their red blood cells are already more fragile and prone to destruction.

Aplastic crisis, which is the sudden cessation of red blood cell production, is a direct consequence of this viral infection in individuals with hereditary spherocytosis. It is characterized by severe anemia, which can be life-threatening due to the inability of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells.

Mild to moderate splenomegaly (A) might be seen in some cases of parvovirus B19 infection, but it is not the most direct consequence in individuals with hereditary spherocytosis.

Gallstones (C) are not directly related to parvovirus B19 infection in individuals with hereditary spherocytosis.

The Lund and Browder chart is a commonly used method to estimate TBSA in children. 

According to the Lund and Browder chart for a 2-year-old child:
- Head and neck: 18%
- Each arm: 9%
- Each leg: 13.5% (since the chart is based on the length of the limbs, which increases with age)
- Front and back of torso: approximately 18% each (total 36%)

Given the description, the child has burns on the buttocks, both legs, face, and neck. However, since the buttocks are considered part of the posterior torso, we will include it in the 18% for the back of the torso.

Now, calculating the total TBSA burned:
- Head and neck: 18%
- Face (considered part of the head and neck): 18% (already included in the 18% for head and neck)
- Buttocks (part of the posterior torso): 18%
- Each leg: 13.5% (2 legs = 27%)
- Total = 18% + 0 (face already included) + 18% + 27% = 63%

However, this exceeds the options provided. The Lund and Browder chart is not an exact science and is meant to provide an estimate. Let's re-evaluate the areas that might have been overestimated:
- The face and neck might be considered together as a single unit on the chart, potentially reducing the total percentage.
- The buttocks could be considered as part of the posterior torso or possibly as part of the lower leg area in a simplified estimation.

Considering these factors and given the options provided (A, B, C, D), the closest and most reasonable estimate based on the Lund and Browder chart and the provided options would be to consider the total TBSA affected as being closer to the lower end of the estimated range.

201,Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is caused by ?,"['Enterovirus 70', 'Adenovirus', 'Poliovirus', 'Hepadnavirus']","To answer this question, I'll consider the options given and my knowledge of common causes of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious and common condition characterized by sudden onset of hemorrhage in the conjunctiva, usually accompanied by severe itching, redness, and watery discharge. The condition often spreads rapidly in crowded areas.

Among the options given, the most commonly associated virus with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is Enterovirus 70. This virus is known to cause outbreaks of this condition, which is characterized by the sudden onset of symptoms that can be quite severe. Enterovirus 70 is a specific type of enterovirus that is more commonly associated with this particular disease than the other options listed.

Adenovirus (option B) can cause a variety of eye infections, including conjunctivitis, but it is not the primary cause of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.

Poliovirus (option C) primarily causes poliomyelitis, a disease that affects the nervous system, and is not typically associated with conjunctivitis.

Hepadnavirus (option D) refers to a family of viruses that include hepatitis B virus. While hepatitis B can cause a variety of systemic infections and complications, it is not known to cause conjunctivitis.

203,In a 24 year old man weight of the upper limb is transmitted to the axial skeleton by:,"['Coracoacromial ligament', 'Coracoclavicular ligament', 'Costoclavicular ligament', 'Coracohumeral ligament']","To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the function of each ligament mentioned in the options.

A. Coracoacromial ligament: This ligament forms a coracoacromial arch, which helps protect the shoulder joint and the axillary nerve. It is not directly involved in transmitting the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.

B. Coracoclavicular ligament: This ligament connects the coracoid process of the scapula to the clavicle. It plays a crucial role in transmitting the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton by forming a strong connection between the scapula and the clavicle, which in turn is attached to the sternum and the spine.

C. Costoclavicular ligament: This ligament connects the clavicle to the first rib. While it does play a role in stabilizing the shoulder girdle, it is not primarily responsible for transmitting the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.

D. Coracohumeral ligament: This ligament connects the coracoid process of the scapula to the greater tubercle of the humerus. It is primarily involved in stabilizing the shoulder joint, rather than transmitting the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.

Given the options, the coracoclavicular ligament is the most relevant structure for transmitting the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.

A. Electrophysiological testing: This type of testing is used to evaluate the electrical activity of the heart. It can help identify abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) that may cause syncope. Therefore, electrophysiological testing is useful in a patient with a history of syncope.

B. Tilt Table testing: This test is used to diagnose vasovagal syncope, a common cause of fainting. During the test, the patient is strapped to a table that tilts upwards. The test helps to evaluate the body's response to changes in position, which can trigger a vasovagal response. Thus, tilt table testing is useful in a patient with a history of syncope.

D. Holter monitoring: This test involves wearing a portable device that records the heart's activity over a 24-hour period. It can help identify abnormal heart rhythms or other conditions that may cause syncope. Therefore, Holter monitoring is useful in a patient with a history of syncope.

C. PET Scan: A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is a medical imaging test that uses a radioactive tracer to visualize the body's metabolic processes. It is primarily used to diagnose conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. A PET scan is not typically used to diagnose or investigate syncope, which is often related to cardiovascular or neurological causes that can be evaluated with other, more specific tests.

206,Antibodies associated with GTCS in SLE :,"['Anti neuronal ab', 'Anti-Ro ab', 'Anti-Sm ab', 'None']","To answer this question, let's break down the key components:

1. **GTCS in SLE**: GTCS stands for Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures, and SLE is Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the brain.

2. **Antibodies associated with GTCS in SLE**: We are looking for the specific antibodies that are linked with an increased risk of GTCS in patients with SLE.

Let's examine the options:

A. **Anti-neuronal antibodies**: These are associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations in SLE, including seizures. They target neuronal antigens, which could contribute to the development of GTCS.

B. **Anti-Ro antibodies (SS-A)**: These are commonly seen in SLE and are often associated with subacute cutaneous lupus, neonatal lupus, and sometimes with serositis and arthritis. They are not directly linked with GTCS.

C. **Anti-Sm antibodies**: This is a specific antibody to the Sm protein found in the cell nucleus. The presence of anti-Sm antibodies is highly specific for SLE but not directly associated with GTCS.

D. **None**: This option suggests that none of the antibodies listed are associated with GTCS in SLE.

207,Which of the following statements about Total Infra–Venous Anaesthesia (TIVA) is true –,"['Causes More Renal Toxicity', 'Reduces Cerebral Metabolic Rate', 'Risk of Malignant Hyperthermia is high', 'Inhibits Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasconstriction']","TIVA is a type of anesthesia that uses intravenous medications to induce and maintain anesthesia, rather than inhalational agents. This type of anesthesia is often used in patients who are at high risk for complications from inhalational anesthesia, such as those with certain lung or heart conditions.

Option B, ""Reduces Cerebral Metabolic Rate"", is correct because TIVA often uses medications that can reduce the cerebral metabolic rate, which can help to decrease the amount of anesthetic required and reduce the risk of anesthetic-related complications.

Option A, ""Causes More Renal Toxicity"", is incorrect because while certain IV anesthetics may have renal toxicity as a side effect, it is not a characteristic of TIVA as a whole.

Option C, ""Risk of Malignant Hyperthermia is high"", is incorrect because malignant hyperthermia is a complication of inhalational anesthesia, not IV anesthesia.

Option D, ""Inhibits Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction"", is incorrect because this is actually a characteristic of some inhalational anesthetics, not TIVA.

210,Shock causes:,"['Stagnant hypoxia', 'Anemic hypoxia', 'Hypoxic hypoxia', 'Histotoxic hypoxia']","To answer this question, let's break down the options related to types of hypoxia and how they relate to shock:

A. Stagnant hypoxia: This type of hypoxia occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow to tissues, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery. Shock, which is characterized by inadequate circulation and reduced blood flow to vital organs, would indeed cause stagnant hypoxia.

B. Anemic hypoxia: This type of hypoxia occurs when the body has a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin, which reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. While severe anemia can lead to hypoxia, shock itself is more directly related to issues of blood flow rather than the composition of the blood.

C. Hypoxic hypoxia: This type of hypoxia occurs when the body (or a part of the body) is deprived of oxygen due to inadequate air intake or breathing difficulties. This is more commonly associated with conditions like high altitude or respiratory disease, rather than the circulatory issues present in shock.

D. Histotoxic hypoxia: This type of hypoxia occurs when tissues are poisoned by substances that interfere with the use of oxygen, such as cyanide. This is not directly related to the circulatory issues in shock.

Given these explanations, the most appropriate answer related to the effects of shock on the body is related to the reduction in blood flow, which would lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.

211,A patient with cushinoid features presents with hemoptysis; he shows no response to dexamethasone suppression test; most likely diagnosis here is:,"['Adrenal hyperplasia', 'Adrenal adenoma', 'Ca lung with ectopic ACTH production', 'Pituitary microadenoma']","To approach this question, let's break down the key points and options:

1. **Cushinoid features**: This refers to the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, which include weight gain, moon face, buffalo hump, and purple striae. These symptoms are caused by excess cortisol in the body.

2. **Hemoptysis**: This is the coughing up of blood, which indicates bleeding in the respiratory tract. This symptom can be associated with lung cancer.

3. **No response to dexamethasone suppression test**: This test is used to diagnose and differentiate causes of Cushing's syndrome. Dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) is administered to suppress ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) production by the pituitary gland, which in turn should suppress cortisol production by the adrenal glands. Failure to suppress cortisol levels with dexamethasone suggests that the cause of Cushing's syndrome is not ACTH-dependent, as in the case of pituitary adenomas (like pituitary microadenoma, option D).

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A. **Adrenal hyperplasia**: This is a condition where the adrenal glands become overactive, leading to Cushing's syndrome. However, adrenal hyperplasia would typically show some suppression with dexamethasone, as it is an ACTH-dependent cause.

B. **Adrenal adenoma**: This is a benign tumor on the adrenal gland that can cause Cushing's syndrome by producing cortisol independently of ACTH. It would likely show no suppression with dexamethasone, making it a plausible diagnosis given the information.

C. **Ca lung with ectopic ACTH production**: This refers to lung cancer that produces ACTH ectopically (outside the pituitary gland). This would indeed cause Cushing's syndrome but would typically show suppression with dexamethasone since the source of ACTH is being suppressed by the dexamethasone.

D. **Pituitary microadenoma**: This is a small tumor in the pituitary gland that produces ACTH, leading to Cushing's syndrome. This would typically show suppression with dexamethasone, as the dexamethasone suppresses the ACTH production by the tumor.

Considering the lack of suppression with dexamethasone, the most likely diagnosis is B. **Adrenal adenoma**, as this condition is characterized by the adrenal gland producing cortisol independently of ACTH and would not respond to dexamethasone suppression.

Monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and Diiodotyrosine (DIT) are intermediates in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. They are not the final products, but rather precursors to the active hormones.

T3 (Triiodothyronine) and Reverse T3 (rT3) are the active thyroid hormones produced in the thyroid gland. T3 is the active form of thyroid hormone, while rT3 is an inactive form that is produced through the deiodination of T4 (not listed in the options).

Considering the options and the fact that we are looking for the compound present in the maximum concentration in the thyroid, we can eliminate MIT (A), T3 (C), and rT3 (D) as they are either intermediate compounds or the active hormone forms. DIT (B) is the compound present in the highest concentration in the thyroid gland, as it is a key intermediate in the synthesis of T3 and T4.

218,"In pontaic fever, which antigen is seen in urine?","['Lipopolysaccharide-1', 'Lipopolysaccharide-2', 'Lipopolysaccharide-4', 'Lipopolysaccharide-6']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the options provided and relate them to the medical condition in question, which is Leptospirosis, commonly known as Weil's disease or Pontiac fever.

Pontiac fever is a milder form of Leptospirosis, caused by the bacteria Leptospira. Leptospira infections can be associated with the presence of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens in the urine due to the body's immune response to the bacteria.

Given the options, we need to identify which Lipopolysaccharide is most commonly associated with Leptospira infections. Leptospira species are known to have serogroups, and the most relevant for identifying the correct antigen in the context of Leptospirosis would likely match with one of these serogroups.

However, the question specifies Lipopolysaccharide-1, Lipopolysaccharide-2, Lipopolysaccharide-4, and Lipopolysaccharide-6, which doesn't directly correlate with the commonly recognized serogroups of Leptospira (e.g., Icterohaemorrhagiae, Canicola, etc.). This discrepancy suggests that the options may not directly correspond to the serogroups of Leptospira. Given the structure of the question, it seems to be pointing towards a specific antigen related to Leptospirosis.

Since the options don't clearly match known serogroups but are still related to a form of Leptospirosis, I would lean towards the option that suggests a direct association with the disease process. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, including Leptospira. In infections such as Leptospirosis, the presence of LPS in urine is a common marker of infection.

Given the lack of direct correlation with specific serogroups, the best approach would be to select an answer that is most relevant to the disease process itself. Among the provided options, the best choice would be the one that aligns with the common presence of LPS in urine during infections such as Leptospirosis.

230,The retention of dowel in a pin retained crown is increased by,"['Increased length, smooth surface and increased taper.', 'Increased length, serrated surface and increased taper.', 'Increased length, smooth surface and parallel sides.', 'Increased length, serrated surface and parallel sides.']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options in relation to the retention of a dowel in a pin-retained crown.

1. **Length**: A longer dowel provides a greater surface area in contact with the root canal wall, which generally increases retention. Therefore, increased length is a favorable option (A, B, C, and D have this in common).

2. **Surface**: The surface of the dowel affects how it interacts with the root canal. A smooth surface tends to allow for better seating and potentially better retention by reducing the likelihood of the dowel getting stuck or being too tight, which can cause it to shear off. On the other hand, a serrated surface can increase friction, potentially improving retention.

3. **Taper**: A parallel-sided dowel (which implies minimal taper) is generally more retentive than one with increased taper. Increased taper can lead to a greater risk of dowel displacement, especially as the forces applied to the restoration are distributed unevenly along the dowel's length. Minimal taper ensures that the forces applied are distributed more evenly, potentially improving retention.

232,Which is an uricosuric drug-,"['Allopurinol', 'Probenecid', 'Indomethacin', 'Aspirin']","To answer this question, we need to understand what an uricosuric drug is. Uricosuric drugs are medications that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine, which is useful in treating conditions like gout.

Let's look at the options:

A. Allopurinol - This is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces uric acid production, not an uricosuric drug.

B. Probenecid - This is a known uricosuric drug that increases the excretion of uric acid in the urine.

C. Indomethacin - This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can be used to treat gout symptoms, but it's not an uricosuric drug.

D. Aspirin - This is also an NSAID that can be used to treat gout symptoms, but it's not an uricosuric drug.

234,"After an incised wound ,new collagen fibrils are seen along with a thick layer of growing epithelium.The approximate age of the wound is","['4-5days', 'About 1week', '12-24hrs', '24-48 hrs']","To answer this question, we need to understand the stages of wound healing. After an incised wound, the healing process progresses through several stages:

1. **Inflammatory stage** (0-4 days): This is the initial stage where the body responds to injury by increasing blood flow to the area, leading to swelling, redness, and pain.
2. **Proliferative stage** (4-21 days): Following the inflammatory stage, the wound begins to heal through the proliferation of new tissue. This stage includes the formation of granulation tissue, contraction of the wound, and the beginning of epithelialization.

Given the information in the question, the presence of new collagen fibrils along with a thick layer of growing epithelium indicates that the wound is in the proliferative stage. This stage typically begins around 4 days after injury and can last up to 21 days.

However, the question specifies that new collagen fibrils are seen along with a thick layer of growing epithelium, which suggests that the wound is in a more advanced stage of healing within the proliferative phase. This would be consistent with an approximate age of around **1 week** (B) after injury.

Which of the following is the best management option?","['0.2-mg intramuscular (IM) ergonovine (Methergine)', '20 units of IV oxytocin', '10 units of oral oxytocin', '250 mg prostaglandin F2-alpha orally']","The best management option for a patient with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony is to administer a uterotonic agent to stimulate uterine contraction. 

Among the options, intravenous (IV) oxytocin (Option B) is the most effective and commonly recommended treatment for PPH due to uterine atony. It works rapidly to stimulate uterine contractions, helping to control bleeding. 

Option A, ergonovine (Methergine), is an alternative treatment for PPH, but it is typically administered intramuscularly (IM) or sublingually, and it's more likely to cause side effects such as hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. 

Option C, oral oxytocin, is not a standard treatment for PPH due to uterine atony, as oral administration may not be as effective as IV administration, and the dose may be difficult to control.

Option D, prostaglandin F2-alpha, is not commonly used for PPH due to uterine atony, and it's associated with more side effects compared to oxytocin.

Gross alpha activity refers to the total count of alpha particles present in a given volume of water, while Gross beta activity refers to the total count of beta particles. Alpha particles are larger and more massive than beta particles, and they have a shorter range in tissue. Therefore, alpha particles are generally considered a greater concern for human health because they can cause more damage to cells.

Given this understanding, it makes sense that the proposed guideline value for Gross alpha activity would be lower than for Gross beta activity, as a lower count of alpha particles would be more hazardous to human health.

The patient's high blood pressure and tachypnea (rapid respirations) also suggest increased ICP.

The most likely diagnosis is a cerebellar hemorrhage (B), which can cause a sudden increase in ICP due to bleeding into the cerebellum, leading to symptoms such as unsteadiness, ataxia, and eventually, altered mental status. The cerebellum is located at the base of the brain and is responsible for balance and coordination, which explains the patient's unsteadiness.

Basal ganglia hemorrhage (A) typically presents with symptoms such as hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body), rigidity, and tremors.

Pontine hemorrhage (C) is a type of brainstem hemorrhage that typically presents with symptoms such as sudden loss of consciousness, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory failure.

238,Bacterial pyogenic parotitis affecting the parotid gland is most common after: March 2008,"['Uveo-parotid fever', 'Mumps', 'Debilitation after major surgery', 'After administration of iodine']","To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option in relation to bacterial pyogenic parotitis affecting the parotid gland.

Bacterial pyogenic parotitis, also known as parotid sialadenitis, is a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the parotid gland due to bacterial infection. It's more common in certain situations where the parotid gland is compromised or the individual is immunocompromised.

A. Uveo-parotid fever (Heerfordt's syndrome) is a manifestation of sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organs, including the eyes and parotid glands. While it affects the parotid gland, it's not a direct cause of bacterial pyogenic parotitis.

B. Mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects the salivary glands, specifically causing parotitis. It's a common cause of parotid gland inflammation but is viral in nature, not bacterial.

C. Debilitation after major surgery is a condition where the body's immune system is weakened due to stress, malnutrition, or infection, making it more susceptible to infections. A compromised immune system increases the risk of bacterial infections, including those of the parotid gland.

D. After administration of iodine, while iodine can have various side effects, there's no direct association between iodine administration and the development of bacterial pyogenic parotitis.

Considering the options and the nature of bacterial pyogenic parotitis, the situation most conducive to developing this condition is when the body is immunocompromised, such as after debilitation from major surgery.

241,Features of neurogenic shock are,"['↑Peripheral resistance ↓ cardiac output', '↑ Venous return ↑ cardiac output', '↓Peripheral resistence↓cardiac output', 'Venoconstriction ↓cardiac output']","To answer this question, let's consider the characteristics of neurogenic shock. Neurogenic shock occurs when there is a sudden loss of spinal cord function, leading to a loss of sympathetic tone. This results in vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and a subsequent drop in blood pressure.

Given this understanding, let's evaluate the options:

A. ↑Peripheral resistance ↓ cardiac output - This option is incorrect because neurogenic shock is characterized by vasodilation, which would lead to decreased peripheral resistance, not increased.

B. ↑ Venous return ↑ cardiac output - This option is also incorrect because in neurogenic shock, vasodilation and pooling of blood in the veins would actually decrease venous return to the heart, not increase it.

C. ↓Peripheral resistance ↓cardiac output - This option accurately describes the pathophysiology of neurogenic shock. The loss of sympathetic tone leads to vasodilation, resulting in decreased peripheral resistance, and subsequently, a decrease in cardiac output due to reduced blood volume returning to the heart.

D. Venoconstriction ↓cardiac output - This option is incorrect because venoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) would increase peripheral resistance, which is the opposite of what occurs in neurogenic shock.

Given the options, I will reason as follows:

A. This statement is true. RDS usually occurs in infants born before 34 weeks of gestation, as their lungs are not fully developed and may not produce enough surfactant to prevent lung collapse.

B. This statement is also true. Babies born to diabetic mothers are at increased risk of RDS, as diabetes can cause the mother's body to produce excess insulin, which can lead to fetal macrosomia and increased risk of RDS.

C. This statement is true as well. RDS leads to cyanosis, which is a bluish discoloration of the skin due to inadequate oxygenation of the blood.

D. This statement is false. RDS is not typically treated by administering 100% oxygen. In fact, high concentrations of oxygen can be harmful to premature infants with RDS, as it can cause damage to their retinas and other tissues. Treatment for RDS usually involves administering surfactant, a medication that helps to reduce lung surface tension, as well as mechanical ventilation to support breathing.

A. Pituitary adenoma: This is actually a cause of ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome, not ACTH-independent. ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone) is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.

B. Adrenal hyperplasia: This can be a cause of ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome. The adrenal glands can become overactive and produce excess cortisol without ACTH stimulation.

C. Adrenocortical carcinoma: This is a cause of ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome. A tumor on the adrenal gland can produce excess cortisol, leading to Cushing syndrome without ACTH stimulation.

D. McCune-Albright Syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder that can cause ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome. It involves fibrous dysplasia of bone, café-au-lait skin spots, and various endocrine disorders, including Cushing syndrome caused by adrenal tumors or nodules.

Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphatase","['D-C-A-B', 'A-C-D-B', 'B-A-D-C', 'C-D-B-A']","To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of reactions in gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is the process by which glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources like lactate, glycerol, and certain amino acids. The correct sequence should reflect the flow of substrates and products through this pathway.

1. **Pyruvate carboxylase (A)** is involved in converting pyruvate into oxaloacetate, a key step early in gluconeogenesis.
   
2. **Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (C)** acts on oxaloacetate to convert it into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), another critical step in the pathway.

3. **Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (D)** is responsible for converting fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate.

4. **Glucose-6-phosphatase (B)** is the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of gluconeogenesis, converting glucose-6-phosphate into glucose, which can then be released into the bloodstream.

Considering the direction of the reactions and the flow of intermediates in gluconeogenesis, we should start with pyruvate carboxylase converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is then converted to PEP by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. From PEP, the pathway proceeds to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate via several steps not listed here, and finally, glucose-6-phosphatase converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose.

Given the options, the correct sequence should logically be A-C-D-B because we start with converting pyruvate to a precursor for the pathway (A), then move to converting that precursor into PEP (C), followed by converting intermediates to the final product (D and B in sequence).

258,Spore forming anaerobic gram positive bacilli ?,"['Bacillus Anthracis', 'Clostridia', 'Corynebacterium', 'Peptostreptococcus']","To answer this question, let's break down the characteristics mentioned:

* Spore-forming: This means the bacteria can produce spores, which are highly resistant structures that allow them to survive in harsh environments.
* Anaerobic: These bacteria do not require oxygen to grow and can actually be harmed or killed by oxygen.
* Gram-positive: This means the bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan cell wall that retains the crystal violet stain during the Gram staining process.
* Bacilli: This refers to the shape of the bacteria, specifically rod-shaped or bacillus-shaped.

With these characteristics in mind, let's examine the options:

A. Bacillus Anthracis: This is a type of Bacillus species that is indeed spore-forming, gram-positive, and rod-shaped. However, it is typically aerobe or facultative anaerobe, not strictly anaerobic.

B. Clostridia: This genus of bacteria fits all the characteristics mentioned: they are spore-forming, anaerobic, gram-positive, and rod-shaped. Clostridia include species like Clostridium difficile and Clostridium tetani.

C. Corynebacterium: These bacteria are gram-positive, but they are typically small and pleomorphic (irregularly shaped) rather than rod-shaped. They are also facultatively aerobic, not strictly anaerobic.

D. Peptostreptococcus: This genus is anaerobic, gram-positive, and shaped like cocci (spherical cells), not bacilli.

White-dot syndromes are a group of conditions characterized by the presence of white or yellowish lesions on the retina, typically with minimal to no inflammation. They can be idiopathic or associated with various conditions.

A. Fuch's heterochromic uveitis: This is a form of chronic, low-grade uveitis that affects one eye, often with heterochromia (color difference) of the iris. It is considered a type of white-dot syndrome, particularly the intermediate type.

B. VKH (Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada) syndrome: This is a form of uveitis that affects multiple parts of the eye, including the retina, choroid, and optic nerve. VKH can present with white-dot lesions on the retina and is associated with inflammation in the eye, which is not typical of most white-dot syndromes.

C. HIV retinopathy: This condition is characterized by the presence of cotton-wool spots in the retina, which is a type of white-dot lesion. HIV retinopathy is often associated with HIV infection.

D. Sympathetic ophthalmitis: This is a rare, bilateral granulomatous uveitis that can occur after penetrating eye injury or surgery. It involves inflammation in both eyes and can present with white-dot lesions on the retina.

Given the definitions and characteristics of each condition, the one that stands out as not being a typical cause of white-dot syndrome is VKH syndrome, because it is primarily an inflammatory condition that affects multiple parts of the eye, whereas most white-dot syndromes are characterized by the presence of white dots with minimal to no inflammation.

263,DNA dependent RNA synthesis is inhibited by:,"['Rifampicin', 'Ethambutol', 'Colchicine', 'Chloromycetin']","To answer this question, we need to understand the mechanism of action of the given options.

Rifampicin (Option A) is a well-known inhibitor of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. It works by binding to the beta subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase enzyme, which is essential for transcription. This binding prevents the enzyme from initiating RNA synthesis, effectively inhibiting the growth of bacteria.

Ethambutol (Option B) is primarily an inhibitor of the enzyme arabinosyl transferase, which is involved in the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. It is not directly involved in DNA-dependent RNA synthesis.

Colchicine (Option C) is a microtubule inhibitor that disrupts the polymerization of microtubules, which are essential for cell division and migration. It is used in the treatment of gout and does not affect DNA-dependent RNA synthesis.

Chloromycetin (Option D), also known as chloramphenicol, inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. This binding prevents the formation of peptide bonds, effectively halting protein synthesis.

264,TYNDALLISATION is a type of,"['intermittent sterilization', 'pasteurisation', 'boiling', 'autoclaving']","To answer this question, let's consider what Tyndallization is. Tyndallization is a process used to sterilize liquids, such as water or a nutrient broth, that cannot be boiled due to their pH, viscosity, or other properties. It involves heating the liquid to a very high temperature for a short period, followed by a cooling period to allow any suspended bacteria to germinate. This process is repeated several times to ensure that all bacteria are killed.

Given this definition, let's look at the options provided:

A. intermittent sterilization - This option aligns with the description of Tyndallization as it involves heating and cooling in an intermittent manner.
B. pasteurisation - This is a process of killing bacteria by heating a liquid to a temperature that is not sufficient to kill all bacteria but is enough to kill pathogens that can cause disease. It's not the same as Tyndallization.
C. boiling - While boiling is a form of heating, Tyndallization is more complex and involves multiple heating and cooling cycles, making this option incorrect.
D. autoclaving - This is a process of sterilization using steam under pressure. While effective, it is not the same as Tyndallization, which is used for liquids that cannot be boiled due to their properties.

Diagnosis ?","['Pseudostrabismus', 'Accomodative squint', 'Exophoria', 'Esophoria']","Based on the provided information, the child has a mild squint, but other eye parameters are normal, and the only notable feature is an exaggerated epicanthal fold. The corneal reflex is normal, and the child's developmental history is unremarkable.

Pseudostrabismus (Option A) refers to a condition where the eyes appear to be crossed due to an anatomical issue, but there is actually no true strabismus. It is often caused by an exaggerated epicanthal fold, which can give the appearance of a squint.

Given the normal corneal reflex and other eye parameters, the child is unlikely to have a true strabismus (such as esophoria or exophoria). Accommodative squint (Option B) is a type of strabismus that occurs due to a misalignment of the eyes while focusing on near objects, but it would be more likely associated with other signs such as difficulty with near vision or convergence.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the child is pseudostrabismus due to the exaggerated epicanthal fold.

A. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, although other joints can be involved. It's characterized by inflammation of the spinal joints (vertebrae) that can lead to severe, chronic pain and discomfort. The iliac crests are often affected in AS, as the disease can cause sacroiliitis, which is inflammation of the sacroiliac joints, where the sacrum and ilium bones meet.

B. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to attack the lining of the joints, leading to pain, swelling, and potentially severe joint damage. RA typically affects the hands, wrists, knees, elbows, ankles, and feet, but it can involve other joints as well.

C. Reiter's syndrome, also known as reactive arthritis, is a form of arthritis that occurs in reaction to an infection elsewhere in the body, typically in the gastrointestinal tract or the urethra. It's characterized by the classic triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis. While it can affect various joints, it's not specifically known for iliac crest involvement.

D. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints, leading to pain and stiffness. OA commonly affects weight-bearing joints like the hips, knees, and spine, but it's not typically associated with iliac crest involvement.

This process results in the formation of multiple blastomeres (cells) from the initial zygote.

Option A, ""A series of meiotic divisions forming blastomeres,"" is incorrect because meiotic divisions occur during gametogenesis (sperm and egg formation), not during the cleavage stage of embryonic development.

Option B, ""Production of highly differentiated blastomeres,"" is incorrect because the blastomeres formed during cleavage are not highly differentiated; they are undifferentiated cells.

Option C, ""An increased cytoplasmic content of blastomeres,"" is incorrect because during cleavage, the amount of cytoplasm in each blastomere actually decreases, not increases.

Option D, ""A decrease in size of blastomeres,"" is correct because as the zygote undergoes cleavage, the size of each blastomere decreases, resulting in a large number of small cells.

No mucosal ulceration is seen.","['Active chronic gastritis', 'Acute gastritis', 'Autoimmune gastritis', 'Chronic gastritis']","To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Patient Profile and Symptoms**: The patient is a 49-year-old female experiencing increasing joint pain in her hands and later develops pain in the midsternal area. These symptoms are not directly related to the gastrointestinal issues but are indicative of a systemic or inflammatory process.

2. **Medication**: She is taking ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), for her joint pain. NSAIDs are well-known for their potential to cause gastrointestinal side effects, including gastritis and ulcers, especially with long-term use.

3. **Gastroscopy Findings**: The gastroscopy reveals multiple scattered, punctate hemorrhagic areas in the gastric mucosa. Biopsies from one of these lesions show mucosal erosions with edema and hemorrhage but no mucosal ulceration.

4. **Interpretation of Gastroscopy Findings**: The presence of hemorrhagic lesions with mucosal erosions is indicative of acute inflammation of the gastric mucosa. The absence of mucosal ulceration suggests a more superficial or acute process rather than a chronic one.

Considering these points:

- **Option A (Active chronic gastritis)** suggests a long-standing inflammation with a component of chronic damage. While NSAIDs can exacerbate chronic gastritis, the acute presentation with hemorrhagic lesions is more indicative of an acute process.

- **Option B (Acute gastritis)** aligns with the patient's acute presentation of hemorrhagic lesions and mucosal erosions without ulcers. The use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen) is a common cause of acute gastritis.

- **Option C (Autoimmune gastritis)** is characterized by an autoimmune process leading to chronic inflammation and mucosal atrophy. The patient's acute presentation with no mention of chronic damage or atrophy makes this option less likely.

- **Option D (Chronic gastritis)** implies a long-standing inflammation with possible chronic damage, which does not match the acute presentation and findings in this case.

291,The main difference between dental stone and dental plaster is:,"['Chemical composition', 'Self life', 'Shape and size of particles', 'Solubility in water']","To determine the main difference between dental stone and dental plaster, we need to consider their properties and characteristics.

Dental stone and dental plaster are both types of gypsum products used in dentistry for casting and impression taking. However, they have distinct differences in terms of their composition, properties, and applications.

The main difference between dental stone and dental plaster lies in their chemical composition. Dental stone is primarily composed of calcium sulfate hemihydrate, which is a more stable and less soluble form of calcium sulfate. This composition gives dental stone its superior strength, durability, and accuracy.

On the other hand, dental plaster is composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, which is more soluble and less stable than the hemihydrate form. As a result, dental plaster has lower strength and durability compared to dental stone.

Considering the options provided:

A. Chemical composition - This is the correct answer, as dental stone and dental plaster differ in their chemical composition.
B. Self life - While dental stone has a longer shelf life than dental plaster due to its stability, this is not the main difference between the two.
C. Shape and size of particles - The shape and size of particles may vary between dental stone and dental plaster, but this is not the primary difference between them.
D. Solubility in water - While dental plaster is more soluble in water than dental stone, this is a consequence of their different chemical compositions, rather than the main difference.

292,"A female child with virilization, hypertension with low plasma renin diagnosis is :","['21α hydroxylase deficiency', '11 β hydroxylase deficiency', '3β hydroxylase deficiency', 'Conn’s syndrome']","To solve this question, we need to consider the symptoms and the laboratory findings mentioned. The patient is a female child with virilization, hypertension, and low plasma renin.

Virilization in a female child typically points towards an androgen excess disorder, which could be due to an adrenal or gonadal cause. However, the combination of hypertension and low plasma renin is critical in narrowing down the diagnosis.

In the context of adrenal causes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a key consideration. There are several types of CAH, but the ones that most commonly present with virilization and hypertension are due to defects in cortisol biosynthesis.

- 21α hydroxylase deficiency (A) is the most common cause of CAH and presents with salt-wasting or simple virilizing forms. However, it typically does not cause hypertension due to low renin levels because of the lack of aldosterone production.

- 11 β hydroxylase deficiency (B) is another form of CAH that leads to an overproduction of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), a potent mineralocorticoid. This results in hypertension, low plasma renin, and virilization due to androgen excess. This condition fits the provided clinical and laboratory profile.

- 3β hydroxylase deficiency (C) is a rare form of CAH and typically presents with a different profile of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiencies.

- Conn’s syndrome (D) is a cause of primary aldosteronism, which can lead to hypertension and low plasma renin due to the autonomous overproduction of aldosterone. However, it is not typically associated with virilization in children.

Given the combination of virilization, hypertension, and low plasma renin in a female child, the most appropriate diagnosis is 11 β hydroxylase deficiency, as it explains all aspects of the clinical and laboratory findings.

293,Most sensitive nerve fiber to hypoxia,"['A', 'B', 'C', 'All are equally sensitive']","To answer this question, let's consider the characteristics of each type of nerve fiber and how they respond to hypoxia (oxygen deprivation).

A. A nerve fibers are large, myelinated fibers that are responsible for conducting sensory information, such as pain and temperature. They are relatively robust and not as sensitive to hypoxia as smaller fibers.

B. B nerve fibers are smaller than A fibers and are also myelinated. They are responsible for autonomic functions, such as controlling blood pressure and heart rate. They are somewhat sensitive to hypoxia but not the most sensitive.

C. C nerve fibers are the smallest and most numerous type of nerve fiber. They are unmyelinated and are responsible for conducting pain, temperature, and other sensory information from the skin and other organs. They are very sensitive to hypoxia because they rely on oxidative metabolism for energy production and are less able to adapt to low oxygen levels.

Given this information, it's clear that C nerve fibers are the most sensitive to hypoxia due to their small size, lack of myelination, and reliance on oxidative metabolism.

294,Nasal septum is formed except by,"['Perpendicular plate of ethmoid', 'Vomer', 'Nasal bone', 'Lateral cailage']","To answer this question, we need to consider the anatomy of the nasal septum. The nasal septum is a wall of cartilage and bone that separates the two sides of the nasal passages.

The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone (Option A) and the vomer (Option B) are both components of the nasal septum. The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone is a long, thin plate of bone that forms the upper part of the nasal septum, while the vomer is a small, flat bone that forms the lower part of the nasal septum.

The nasal bone (Option C) is not a direct component of the nasal septum. While it does form part of the lateral wall of the nasal passages, it does not contribute to the formation of the nasal septum.

* The patient is a middle-aged female with a mass in the sella turcica.
* The mass is associated with an increase in hormone production.

The sella turcica is a saddle-shaped depression in the sphenoid bone where the pituitary gland is located. A mass in this area is likely to be a pituitary tumor.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. Prolactin: The pituitary gland produces prolactin, and a prolactinoma is a type of pituitary tumor that can cause an increase in prolactin levels. This would explain the mass and hormone increase in the sella turcica.

B. Thyroxine: Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, not the pituitary gland. While the pituitary gland regulates thyroid function, a mass in the sella turcica would not directly cause an increase in thyroxine.

C. Estrogen: Estrogen is a sex hormone produced by the ovaries, adrenal glands, and fat cells, but not by the pituitary gland. A mass in the sella turcica would not directly cause an increase in estrogen.

D. ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): ADH is produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. While a pituitary tumor could potentially affect ADH production, it is not as directly related to the sella turcica as prolactin is.

Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is:

298,Maximum flow of Type1 inlay wax at 45degree,"['2%', '3%', '10%', '70%']","To answer this question, we need to understand the properties of Type 1 inlay wax, specifically its flow at 45 degrees.

Type 1 inlay wax is a type of dental wax used in dentistry for various applications such as creating dental models, dies, and temporary restorations. The flow of wax is a critical property that affects its usability in dental procedures. Flow refers to the ability of the wax to be molded and shaped without becoming brittle or losing its form.

The flow of wax at different temperatures is a characteristic that is often measured and specified. The flow of wax can be affected by the temperature at which it is tested. The standard test for flow is typically conducted at 40°C (104°F) for a period of 30 minutes, but in this case, we are looking at the specific flow at 45 degrees, which is a slightly higher temperature.

The correct flow of Type 1 inlay wax at 45 degrees is a specific value that is usually referenced in dental materials science or in dental textbooks and resources. However, given the options provided:

A. 2%
B. 3%
C. 10%
D. 70%

Typically, dental waxes, including Type 1 inlay wax, have a relatively low flow to maintain their structure and form. High flow values like 70% (D) would be unusual for a dental wax that needs to hold its shape for dental applications.

Considering the usual flow values for dental waxes and the context of the question, option D, 70%, seems less likely to be the correct answer for the flow of Type 1 inlay wax at 45 degrees, as dental waxes generally have lower flow values to maintain their utility in dental procedures.

Among the remaining options (A, B, C), without a specific reference to the correct flow value for Type 1 inlay wax at 45 degrees, we can reason that the flow should be low to moderate, as it needs to be moldable but not too fluid to lose its shape. However, given the options, choosing between A, B, and C requires specific knowledge of Type 1 inlay wax's flow at 45 degrees, which is not provided here.

However, considering standard dental practices and the typical properties of dental waxes, the flow at 45 degrees is likely to be on the lower side to ensure the wax remains moldable but holds its shape. Therefore, the most plausible answer, based on general knowledge and without specific data on Type 1 inlay wax at 45 degrees, might lean towards a lower value, but between the options given, a more precise answer cannot be deduced without further information.

Given the constraints and the nature of dental waxes, one might expect the flow to be moderate but without specific data, choosing between A, B, and C is speculative.

However, considering the general principles of dental waxes and the usual flow values, option A, 2%, or option B, 3%, could both be reasonable choices depending on the specific application and the desired properties of the wax. However, without specific knowledge or a reference that directly addresses the flow of Type 1 inlay wax at 45 degrees, selecting the correct answer is speculative.

For the purpose of this exercise, and acknowledging the uncertainty without further information, a typical approach in dental materials might consider lower flow values for waxes that need to hold their shape. However, the actual value can vary significantly based on the specific formulation of the wax and its intended use.

Given the context and the usual flow values for dental waxes, the more plausible choices based on standard dental practices and the need for the wax to be moldable but hold its shape would lean towards lower flow values.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice among those provided, based on a general understanding of dental waxes and without specific data on Type 1 inlay wax at 45 degrees, might lean towards option A, 2%, or option B, 3%, but this is speculative without a direct reference to the flow of Type 1 inlay wax at 45 degrees.

299,The number of ATPs generated in krebs cycleare ?,"['12', '24', '15', '30']","To answer this question, let's break down the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle) and its role in ATP production.

The Krebs cycle is a key process by which cells generate energy. It's a series of chemical reactions that occur within the mitochondria. This cycle is crucial for the breakdown of acetyl-CoA, which is derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The cycle produces energy in the form of ATP, NADH, and FADH2.

However, the question asks specifically about ATP generation. The direct production of ATP from the Krebs cycle is relatively small. The cycle itself does not produce much ATP directly; instead, it produces NADH and FADH2 as by-products, which are then used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP.

For every glucose molecule that enters the Krebs cycle, the cycle itself produces 2 ATP molecules (or more accurately, 2 ATP equivalents because the ATP produced is in the form of ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation). However, the majority of the ATP generated from glucose metabolism is produced in the electron transport chain, where the electrons from NADH and FADH2 are used to pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP.

To give a more precise answer to the original question: in the Krebs cycle, there are two steps where ATP is generated directly through substrate-level phosphorylation, and those steps account for the production of 2 ATPs per cycle. However, when considering the entire process of glucose metabolism, the overall yield of ATP per glucose molecule is significantly higher, thanks to the electron transport chain's role in ATP synthesis.

Given the options and the context of the question:

- Option A suggests 12 ATPs, which seems too high when considering the Krebs cycle's direct contribution to ATP production.
- Option B suggests 24 ATPs, which also seems too high and does not accurately reflect the direct ATP production from the Krebs cycle.
- Option C suggests 15 ATPs, which is not a common figure cited for direct ATP production in the Krebs cycle.
- Option D suggests 30 ATPs, which is far too high and inaccurately represents the ATP generated from the Krebs cycle alone.

However, considering the misunderstanding in the explanation regarding the direct ATP production in the Krebs cycle and the fact that the question asks for ATPs ""generated in Krebs cycle,"" it's clear that none of the options perfectly align with the direct ATP production (which is 2 ATPs per cycle), but none of the explanations provided directly support the options given accurately.

Given the typical understanding and the options provided, none directly match the 2 ATPs produced in the Krebs cycle correctly. However, if we were to select based on the misunderstanding presented and the common educational oversight in how this question is framed, none of the provided options are a correct reflection of the direct ATP production in the Krebs cycle, but if we must choose based on the context provided and typical educational oversights:

* AV node: The atrioventricular (AV) node is a critical structure in the heart that allows for a delay in the transmission of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. This delay is essential for ensuring that the ventricles have time to fill with blood before they contract. The conduction velocity through the AV node is relatively slow, around 0.05 meters per second (m/s).
* Purkinje fibers: These fibers are responsible for the final transmission of electrical impulses to the ventricular muscle, causing contraction. They have a relatively fast conduction velocity, around 2-4 m/s.
* Bundle of His: This is a group of specialized fibers that transmit electrical impulses from the AV node to the ventricles. The conduction velocity through the Bundle of His is faster than the AV node but slower than the Purkinje fibers, around 1-2 m/s.
* Ventricular myocardial fibers: These are the muscle fibers of the ventricles that contract to pump blood. They have a relatively fast conduction velocity, around 1-4 m/s.

A. Homocystinemia: Elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood (homocystinemia) are known to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Therefore, this option does predispose to atherosclerosis.

B. Fibrinogen: Fibrinogen is a protein involved in blood clotting, and elevated levels of fibrinogen are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. So, this option also predisposes to atherosclerosis.

C. Calcium: While calcium is a crucial element, the specific mention of ""Calcium"" without context might be confusing. However, in the context of atherosclerosis, we're more concerned with calcium in the form of calcium deposits in arterial walls (calcification), which is a marker of atherosclerosis but not a direct cause.

311,Metoprolol is preferred over Propranolol as it: September 2010,"['Is more potent in blocking beta-1 receptors', 'Is more potent in blocking beta-2 receptors', 'Is more effective in suppressing essential tremors', 'Impairs exercise capacity']","To answer this question, let's consider the properties and uses of both metoprolol and propranolol.

Metoprolol and propranolol are both beta-blockers, but they have some differences in their pharmacology and clinical use. Metoprolol is a selective beta-1 blocker, primarily affecting the heart by reducing heart rate and blood pressure. It has less effect on the lungs and peripheral blood vessels compared to non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol.

Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker, meaning it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Beta-2 receptors are found in the lungs, where they cause bronchodilation (widening of the airways), and in the peripheral blood vessels, where they cause vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). Blocking these receptors can lead to bronchoconstriction and peripheral vasoconstriction, which can be problematic for patients with asthma or certain cardiovascular conditions.

Given these properties, let's evaluate the options:

A. Is more potent in blocking beta-1 receptors: This is correct. Metoprolol is a selective beta-1 blocker, making it more potent in blocking beta-1 receptors than propranolol.

B. Is more potent in blocking beta-2 receptors: This is incorrect. Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker, so it's actually more potent in blocking beta-2 receptors than metoprolol.

C. Is more effective in suppressing essential tremors: This is incorrect. Propranolol, being a non-selective beta-blocker, is actually more effective in suppressing essential tremors.

D. Impairs exercise capacity: This is incorrect. Metoprolol, by virtue of its selective beta-1 blockade, is less likely to impair exercise capacity compared to propranolol, which can cause bronchoconstriction and peripheral vasoconstriction.

Which of the following is best next step in the management?","['Immediate removal of the tracheostomy tube', 'Suction of tube with sodium bicarbonate', 'Suction of tube with saline', 'Jet ventilation']","In a case of sudden complete blockage of a tracheostomy tube, the priority is to secure the airway and establish a patent airway as quickly as possible. Removing the tracheostomy tube (Option A) is the best next step. This is because the blockage is likely to be causing a significant obstruction, and removing the tube will allow for the restoration of a patent airway. Suctioning the tube with either sodium bicarbonate or saline (Options B and C) may not be effective in clearing the blockage, and could potentially make the situation worse by pushing the blockage further down the tube or causing further obstruction. Jet ventilation (Option D) is not a suitable option in this scenario, as it may not be effective in clearing the blockage and could potentially worsen the situation.

314,Which component transfers four protons:,"['NADH-Q Oxidoreductase', 'Cytochrome -C oxidase', 'Cytochrome C - Q oxidoredictase', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase']","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. The question is about which component transfers four protons. This refers to the electron transport chain, specifically the process where protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane during oxidative phosphorylation.

A. NADH-Q Oxidoreductase, also known as Complex I, is the first complex in the electron transport chain. It is responsible for transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (Q), but it doesn't directly transfer protons.

B. Cytochrome-C oxidase (Complex IV) is the last complex in the electron transport chain. It transfers electrons to oxygen, forming water, and pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, it typically pumps fewer than four protons per electron pair it acts on.

C. Cytochrome C - Q oxidoreductase, also known as Complex III (or Cytochrome b-c1 complex), transfers electrons from cytochrome c to ubiquinol (QH2), pumping protons across the membrane. It is known for pumping a significant number of protons during the electron transport chain process.

D. Isocitrate Dehydrogenase is not directly involved in the electron transport chain but is an enzyme in the Krebs cycle, which produces NADH and FADH2, both of which feed into the electron transport chain.

Given the above information, the component that best matches the description of transferring four protons is related to the electron transport chain process, making option C the most accurate answer.

A. M-protein is responsible for production of mucoid colonies: This statement is incorrect. M-protein is actually responsible for the virulence of streptococci, not the production of mucoid colonies. The production of mucoid colonies is due to the presence of a thick capsule made of hyaluronic acid.

B. M-protein is responsible for virulence: This statement is correct. The M-protein is a major virulence factor of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), and it plays a key role in evading the host immune response.

C. Mucoid colonies are virulent: This statement is correct. Mucoid colonies are typically associated with streptococci that have a thick capsule, which is a virulence factor that helps the bacteria evade the host immune system.

D. Classified based on their haemolytic properties: This statement is correct. Streptococci can be classified based on their hemolytic properties, with alpha-hemolytic, beta-hemolytic, and gamma-hemolytic groups being the main categories.

317,In a young female of reproductive age an absolute contraindication for prescribing oral contraceptive pills is:,"['Diabetes', 'Hypertension', 'Obesity', 'Impaired liver function']","The correct answer is D. Impaired liver function.

Impaired liver function is an absolute contraindication for prescribing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) because the liver is responsible for metabolizing the hormones in OCPs, and impaired liver function can lead to an accumulation of these hormones, which can increase the risk of adverse effects, including liver damage and stroke.

The other options are not absolute contraindications for prescribing OCPs:

* Diabetes (A) is not an absolute contraindication, but women with diabetes should be closely monitored for changes in blood glucose levels.
* Hypertension (B) is a relative contraindication, and OCPs should be prescribed with caution in women with hypertension.
* Obesity (C) is not an absolute contraindication, but women with obesity may be at a higher risk of certain side effects, such as venous thromboembolism.

318,Acute Gouty ahritis is seen early in treatment following -,"['Probenecid', 'Allopurinol', 'Rasburicase', 'All of the above']","The correct answer is B. Allopurinol.

Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is used to treat chronic gout. However, it can actually trigger an acute gouty attack early in treatment due to the rapid reduction in uric acid levels. This is because the body has adapted to the higher uric acid levels and the sudden drop can cause an inflammatory response.

Probenecid (Option A) works by increasing uric acid excretion and is less likely to cause an acute attack early in treatment. Rasburicase (Option C) is an enzyme that breaks down uric acid and is typically used in the treatment of tumor lysis syndrome.

320,Late metabolic acidosis is seen in-,"['Term infant given formula feed', 'Preterm baby getting cow milk', 'Long term breast feeding', 'None of the above']","To answer this question, we need to understand what ""late metabolic acidosis"" refers to. Metabolic acidosis is a condition where the body's fluids become too acidic. This can be due to various reasons, including but not limited to, the type of diet a person or, in this case, a baby is on.

In infants, the primary source of nutrition is either breast milk or formula. Breast milk is naturally more alkaline (or less acidic) compared to formula, especially cow's milk-based formula. Cow's milk is high in protein and low in phosphate, which can lead to a higher excretion of hydrogen ions in the urine, making the urine more acidic. This, in turn, can lead to a condition known as metabolic acidosis, especially in preterm infants whose kidneys are not mature enough to handle the acidic load effectively.

Given the options:

A. Term infant given formula feed - While formula can contribute to metabolic acidosis, term infants are less likely to develop late metabolic acidosis compared to preterm infants due to their more mature kidneys.

B. Preterm baby getting cow milk - This is the most likely scenario to result in late metabolic acidosis. Preterm babies have immature kidneys and are more susceptible to metabolic disturbances due to their diet, including the potential for metabolic acidosis from cow's milk-based formula.

C. Long term breast feeding - Breast milk is naturally more alkaline and provides optimal nutrition for infants. Breastfeeding is generally not associated with metabolic acidosis.

D. None of the above - This option would be incorrect given the explanation provided for option B.

321,Chemotherapeutic drugs can cause?,"['Only necrosis', 'Only apoptosis', 'Both necrosis and apoptosis', 'Anoikis']","To approach this question, let's break down the key concepts involved:

1. **Chemotherapeutic drugs**: These are medications used to treat cancer by targeting and killing rapidly dividing cancer cells.

2. **Necrosis**: This is a form of cell injury that results in the premature death of cells and tissues by autolysis. Necrosis is a form of accidental cell death and is often the result of cell damage from infection, toxins, or trauma. It is not a targeted form of cell death.

3. **Apoptosis**: This is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. Apoptosis is crucial for normal development and maintaining health by eliminating old, unnecessary, or damaged cells. It is a targeted form of cell death that can be induced by certain chemotherapeutic drugs.

4. **Anoikis**: This is a form of programmed cell death that occurs when cells detach from the surrounding tissue and lose contact with the extracellular matrix. Anoikis is not directly related to the action of chemotherapeutic drugs.

Given these definitions:

- Chemotherapeutic drugs can indeed induce apoptosis as a targeted way to kill cancer cells.
- It is also possible for chemotherapeutic drugs to cause necrosis, especially if the dose is too high or if the drug damages the cell membrane, leading to cell death.
- Anoikis is not directly related to the action of chemotherapeutic drugs.

Therefore, the correct answer is the one that includes both necrosis and apoptosis as the types of cell death that can be caused by chemotherapeutic drugs.

To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option:

A. Multiple blood transfusions: While not as directly linked as some other factors, multiple blood transfusions can increase the risk of ARDS due to the potential for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or other transfusion-related complications.

B. Septicemia: This is a well-recognized predisposing factor for ARDS. Severe infections can lead to a systemic inflammatory response, which can cause lung injury and ARDS.

D. Toxic gas inhalation: Exposure to toxic gases can cause severe lung damage and is a well-documented risk factor for ARDS.

C. Status asthmaticus: While status asthmaticus is a severe and life-threatening condition, it is not typically considered a predisposing factor for ARDS in the same way as the other options. Status asthmaticus is usually managed with aggressive asthma treatment, and the primary concern is respiratory failure due to airway obstruction, not lung injury from a systemic inflammatory response.

326,Which of the following nerve is involved in Frey's syndrome?,"['Trigeminal', 'Mandibular', 'Ariculo temporal', 'Lingual']","To answer this question, we need to understand what Frey's syndrome is. Frey's syndrome, also known as gustatory sweating or auriculotemporal syndrome, is a rare neurological disorder that typically results from damage to or near the parotid gland (one of the salivary glands located below and in front of the ear) and its surrounding nerves.

The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. It carries secretory fibers from the parasympathetic nervous system, which innervate the parotid gland, and sensory fibers from the skin of the temple and the TMJ.

Given this information, let's review the options:

A. Trigeminal: While the trigeminal nerve is the parent nerve of the auriculotemporal nerve, it's not the direct answer to Frey's syndrome.

B. Mandibular: The mandibular nerve is another branch of the trigeminal nerve, but it's also not the direct answer to Frey's syndrome.

C. Auriculotemporal: This is the correct answer. Frey's syndrome is characterized by the abnormal regeneration of nerve fibers between the auriculotemporal nerve and the overlying skin. When the parotid gland is damaged, the nerve fibers between the auriculotemporal nerve and the sympathetic nervous system can regenerate abnormally, leading to the symptoms of Frey's syndrome.

D. Lingual: The lingual nerve is another branch of the trigeminal nerve that carries taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but it's not involved in Frey's syndrome.

329,Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia can occur when terfenadine(antihistaminic):,"['Is coadministrator with azithromycin', 'Is coadministrator with fluconazole', 'Is given in higher doses', 'Reduces QT interval']","To answer this question, let's consider the properties and side effects of terfenadine, an antihistamine that was withdrawn from the market in 1998 due to concerns about its potential to cause serious cardiac arrhythmias, including polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (also known as Torsades de Pointes).

Terfenadine works by blocking histamine receptors in the body, which helps alleviate symptoms of allergies such as itching, sneezing, and runny nose. However, one of its significant side effects is its potential to prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval represents the time it takes for the heart's ventricles to prepare for a new contraction. Prolongation of the QT interval can lead to an increased risk of dangerous arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes or ventricular fibrillation.

Given the options, let's assess each for its likelihood of causing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia:

A. **Is coadministered with azithromycin**: Azithromycin is an antibiotic known to prolong the QT interval. When taken with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval, such as terfenadine, the risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias increases. This combination is a significant risk factor for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.

B. **Is coadministered with fluconazole**: Fluconazole is an antifungal medication. While certain antifungal drugs can interact with other medications to prolong the QT interval, fluconazole is less commonly associated with this effect compared to other antifungal agents like ketoconazole.

C. **Is given in higher doses**: Higher doses of terfenadine would indeed increase the risk of adverse effects, including potential prolongation of the QT interval. However, this option is less specific than option A regarding the potential for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, as the question asks for a specific scenario that increases the risk.

D. **Reduces QT interval**: This option is incorrect because terfenadine is known to prolong the QT interval, not reduce it.

Considering the potential for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with terfenadine, the most direct and significant risk factor among the options provided is its coadministration with a drug that also prolongs the QT interval, such as azithromycin.

358,"Five days after an uneventful cholecystectomy, an asymptomatic middle-aged woman is found to have a serum sodium level of 125 mEq/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient?","['Administration of hypeonic saline solution', 'Restriction of free water', 'Plasma ultrafiltration', 'Hemodialysis']","To address this question, let's consider the scenario and the options provided.

The patient is a middle-aged woman, five days post-cholecystectomy, presenting with asymptomatic hyponatremia (serum sodium level of 125 mEq/L). Hyponatremia is a condition characterized by a low sodium concentration in the blood. The management strategy for hyponatremia depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition.

A. Administration of hypertonic saline solution: Hypertonic saline is often used in cases of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, particularly if the patient is experiencing neurological symptoms due to the hyponatremia. However, in this case, the patient is asymptomatic.

B. Restriction of free water: This is often the initial management strategy for asymptomatic hyponatremia, especially if the hyponatremia is mild. Restricting free water can help to increase the serum sodium concentration by reducing the amount of water in the body relative to sodium.

C. Plasma ultrafiltration: This is not a commonly used treatment for hyponatremia. Plasma ultrafiltration is sometimes used in the management of certain types of fluid overload or in patients with severe kidney dysfunction, but it is not typically used for hyponatremia.

D. Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is a treatment typically reserved for patients with severe kidney failure or in cases of severe electrolyte imbalances that are not responsive to other treatments. It is not usually the first-line treatment for hyponatremia, especially in the absence of other complicating factors.

Given the patient's asymptomatic status and the need for a conservative approach to manage hyponatremia in the absence of symptoms, the most appropriate initial management strategy would be to restrict free water, aiming to correct the hyponatremia gradually while avoiding rapid changes in sodium levels that could lead to complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome.

- Goodpasture's syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the basement membrane of the lungs and kidneys. It is known for causing damage to the alveoli and glomeruli, leading to conditions such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (C) and glomerulonephritis (A).

- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is indeed a hallmark of Goodpasture's syndrome, so option C is consistent with the condition.

- Glomerulonephritis is also a feature, as the disease affects the glomeruli in the kidneys, leading to their inflammation.

- The presence of antibodies to the basement membrane is a defining characteristic of Goodpasture's syndrome, making option D accurate.

- Leucocytoclastic vasculitis, however, is more commonly associated with conditions such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura, not Goodpasture's syndrome. Goodpasture's syndrome specifically targets the basement membrane of the lungs and kidneys without the typical vasculitis seen in other autoimmune diseases.

1. The parents are clinically normal: This suggests that the disorder is not inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) pattern, as a parent would be affected if it were.
2. Only siblings are affected: This indicates that the disorder is likely inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) pattern, as both parents are carriers and only their offspring are affected.
3. Males and females are affected in equal proportions: This eliminates X-linked dominant (XLD) and X-linked recessive (XLR) patterns, as XLD would typically affect females more frequently than males, and XLR would rarely affect females.

Given these characteristics, the disorder is most likely inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) pattern, which means that both parents are carriers and only their offspring can be affected.

362,Which bacteria acts by inhibiting protein synthesis?,"['Pseudomonas', 'Staphylococcus', 'Streptococcus', 'Klebsiella']","To answer this question, we need to identify which bacteria acts by inhibiting protein synthesis.

Inhibiting protein synthesis typically refers to the bactericidal or bacteriostatic action of certain antibiotics that disrupt the production of proteins essential for bacterial cell function. Among the options provided, one stands out for its notable mechanism of action related to protein synthesis inhibition.

Staphylococcus (B) is a genus of bacteria that is known to cause infections in humans. However, when considering the action of inhibiting protein synthesis, we should note that many antibiotics work by this mechanism. But among the options, Staphylococcus is particularly notable because some of its strains are resistant to a wide range of antibiotics due to the acquisition of resistance genes, but the bacterium itself does not primarily act by inhibiting protein synthesis.

Pseudomonas (A), on the other hand, is known for its ability to cause severe infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a notable pathogen that can produce a range of virulence factors and toxins. Importantly, Pseudomonas is susceptible to antibiotics that target protein synthesis. Specifically, aminoglycosides (like gentamicin), which inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, are effective against Pseudomonas. This makes option A a strong candidate for the correct answer.

Streptococcus (C) and Klebsiella (D) are also important pathogens but are not primarily known for their action on protein synthesis in the context of bacterial infections.

Let's analyze each option:

A. Vertebral secondaries: This option is unlikely to be directly associated with vocal cord palsy, as vertebral metastases would more likely affect the spine or nerves in the neck and thoracic regions.

B. Left atrial enlargement: This condition can cause vocal cord palsy due to the enlarged left atrium compressing the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is a common cause of vocal cord palsy.

C. Bronchogenic carcinoma: Tumors in the lung, especially those originating in the bronchus, can cause vocal cord palsy by compressing or invading the nerves supplying the vocal cords.

D. Secondaries in mediastinum: Metastases in the mediastinum can compress or invade the nerves surrounding the vocal cords, leading to vocal cord palsy.

366,True about primary peritonitis,"['Mostly monobacterial', 'It is chemical peritonitis proceeds secondary peritonitis', 'Needs peritoneal lavage', 'Occurs with Cirrhosis of liver']","The correct answer is D.

Primary peritonitis, also known as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), is an infection of the peritoneal cavity that occurs in the absence of any apparent source of infection, such as a perforated viscus. It is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, particularly those with ascites. The infection is usually caused by a single type of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, and is thought to result from the translocation of bacteria from the gut into the peritoneal cavity.

Option A is incorrect because primary peritonitis is typically caused by a polymicrobial infection, not a monobacterial one.

Option B is incorrect because primary peritonitis is a distinct entity from secondary peritonitis, which occurs in the setting of a perforated viscus or other intra-abdominal source of infection.

Option C is incorrect because peritoneal lavage is not a necessary treatment for primary peritonitis. Antibiotics are the primary treatment.

367,Vitamin K is ivolved in the posttranslational modification?,"['Glutamate', 'Aspartate', 'Leucine', 'Lysine']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider what vitamin K is involved in. Vitamin K is crucial for the production of clotting factors in the liver and for the modification of certain proteins. It plays a key role in the process of gamma-carboxylation, which is a post-translational modification that adds a carboxyl group to certain glutamate residues, converting them to gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). This modification is essential for the function of vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as those involved in blood clotting (e.g., prothrombin, factors II, VII, IX, and X).

Given this context, let's review the options provided:

A. Glutamate - This is the correct answer because vitamin K is involved in the gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residues in proteins.

B. Aspartate - Vitamin K is not directly involved in the modification of aspartate.

370,A obese female having hirsutism on laboratory investigation has high level of LH and androgens. Likely cause is-,"['PCOS', 'Exogenous steroid ingestion', 'Turner syndrome', 'Kleinfelter syndrome']","To answer this question, let's break down the key components:

1. **Obesity and Hirsutism**: Hirsutism is a condition characterized by excessive growth of terminal hairs in a male-like pattern in women, often due to an excess of androgens (male hormones). Obesity is a common comorbidity with hirsutism, and it can exacerbate hormonal imbalances.

2. **High levels of LH and Androgens**: In the context of hirsutism, high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and androgens are significant. LH is a hormone that stimulates the production of androgens in the ovaries. High levels of LH, combined with high levels of androgens, indicate an issue with the body's feedback loop regulating hormone production.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A. PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)**: PCOS is a common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age, characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess androgen levels, and the presence of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. It is often associated with obesity and hirsutism, and it frequently involves high levels of LH and androgens due to the ovaries' failure to respond properly to LH, leading to a cycle of further androgen production.

- **B. Exogenous Steroid Ingestion**: While this could indeed cause elevated androgen levels, it does not directly explain the high levels of LH. Steroid ingestion would disrupt the body's natural hormonal balance but would not typically result in the specific pattern of LH elevation seen in hirsutism.

- **C. Turner Syndrome**: Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder in females characterized by the partial or complete absence of one X chromosome. While it can lead to hormonal imbalances, it is not commonly associated with the specific pattern of high LH and androgens seen in hirsutism.

- **D. Klinefelter Syndrome**: This is a genetic condition found in males where one or more X chromosomes are missing. It's not relevant to female hirsutism and high LH levels.

Given the specific pattern of symptoms (hirsutism, high LH, high androgens, and obesity), PCOS is the most likely cause.

390,Which of the following nerves are affected after spinal anaesthetic block –,"['Motor and sensory only', 'Sensory and autonomic nerve only', 'Sensory nerves only', 'Sensory, autonomic and motor nerves']","To answer this question, let's consider what a spinal anaesthetic block does.

A spinal anaesthetic block involves injecting local anaesthetic into the spinal canal, which surrounds the spinal cord and nerves. This block can affect various types of nerves that pass through the spinal canal.

1. **Sensory nerves**: These nerves transmit sensory information (such as pain, temperature, touch, and pressure) from the body to the brain. Since the spinal anaesthetic block is intended to block pain, it would logically affect these nerves.

2. **Autonomic nerves**: These nerves are part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions of the body, such as heart rate, digestion, and blood pressure. The autonomic nervous system also includes nerves that control the diameter of blood vessels and the smooth muscle of the gut and other viscera. A spinal anaesthetic block can affect these nerves because they are also within the spinal canal.

3. **Motor nerves**: These nerves transmit signals from the central nervous system to muscles and glands, controlling movement. Like sensory and autonomic nerves, motor nerves pass through the spinal canal. Therefore, a spinal anaesthetic block can also affect motor nerves.

Considering these points, a spinal anaesthetic block would affect sensory nerves, autonomic nerves, and motor nerves.

392,Urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is,"['<150 mmol/L', '<300 mmol/L', '<600 mmol/L', '<900 mmol/L']","To answer this question, let's consider what Diabetes Insipidus (DI) is and how it affects the body. DI is a condition characterized by the inability of the body to regulate fluids due to a lack of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. This hormone is crucial for regulating the amount of water in the body by telling the kidneys to reabsorb water back into the bloodstream.

Without sufficient ADH, the kidneys are unable to properly reabsorb water, leading to an excessive production of very diluted urine. This is the hallmark of DI: the production of large volumes of dilute urine. This condition can be central (due to the brain's inability to produce ADH) or nephrogenic (the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH).

Given this understanding, the urine osmolality in a patient with DI would be expected to be very low because the kidneys are not able to concentrate the urine, leading to a very dilute urine output.

Osmolality is a measure of the concentration of osmotically active particles in a solution, usually expressed in units of milliosmoles per kilogram of solvent (mOsm/kg). Normal urine osmolality can vary depending on hydration status, but a very diluted urine would be expected in DI.

397,Magaldrate is conveed by gastric acid to ?,"['Magnesium hydroxide', 'Magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate', 'Magnesium hydroxide and Aluminium hydroxide', 'Calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide']","To solve this, let's break down what Magaldrate is and what it does.

Magaldrate is a medication that is used to treat heartburn, indigestion, and other conditions related to excess stomach acid. It's often used as an antacid.

When Magaldrate comes into contact with gastric acid (the acid in your stomach), it's designed to react with it and form a base, which helps to neutralize the acid and provide relief from symptoms.

Given the options, let's look at what would happen if Magaldrate were to react with gastric acid:

A. Magnesium hydroxide - This is a base that could form if Magaldrate reacts with gastric acid. Magnesium hydroxide is indeed an antacid, and it's often used to treat conditions like heartburn and indigestion.

B. Magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate - While magnesium hydroxide is a possible product of the reaction, there's no clear indication that calcium carbonate would also form from Magaldrate reacting with gastric acid.

401,Which of the following results in increase in secretion of ADH?,"['Hypervolemia', 'Hypeension', 'Hypovolemia', 'Decrease osmolarity']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options in relation to the secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), also known as Vasopressin.

- **ADH is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland**. It plays a crucial role in regulating the amount of water in the body. When ADH levels increase, it causes the kidneys to reabsorb more water back into the body, which in turn leads to a decrease in urine production and an increase in blood volume.

Given this background, let's evaluate the options:

- **A. Hypervolemia**: This condition refers to an excess of fluid in the blood vessels, leading to an increase in blood volume. However, the body would aim to reduce fluid volume in this scenario to avoid further increases in blood pressure and potential damage to the heart and blood vessels. This condition would not typically result in an increase in ADH secretion.

- **B. Hypertension**: While hypertension (high blood pressure) can be a result of increased fluid volume, it is not a direct stimulus for ADH secretion. ADH secretion is more directly related to changes in osmolarity and volume status rather than blood pressure levels per se.

- **C. Hypovolemia**: This condition refers to a decrease in blood volume. The body responds to hypovolemia by increasing ADH secretion to promote water reabsorption in the kidneys, thus increasing blood volume and helping to counteract the effects of blood loss or fluid loss.

- **D. Decrease in osmolarity**: ADH secretion is actually stimulated by an **increase** in osmolarity, not a decrease. High osmolarity indicates that the blood has become more concentrated due to a relative loss of water, prompting the release of ADH to help retain water in the body.

Given the analysis above, the correct answer is the condition that directly stimulates ADH secretion, which is **C. Hypovolemia**. This condition necessitates an increase in ADH to help retain water in the body and increase blood volume.

402,During cardiac imaging the phase of minimum motion of hea is:,"['Late systole', 'Mid systole', 'Late diastole', 'Mid diastole']","To answer this question, we need to understand the cardiac cycle and how it relates to motion during imaging.

The cardiac cycle consists of two main phases: systole and diastole. Systole is the contraction phase, where the heart muscle contracts to pump blood out of the heart. Diastole is the relaxation phase, where the heart muscle relaxes and the heart fills with blood.

Motion during cardiac imaging is typically due to the contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle. Therefore, the phase with the least motion would be the phase with the most relaxation, which occurs during diastole.

Between the two diastolic phases (early diastole and late diastole), late diastole is typically when the heart is at its most still, as the ventricles are fully relaxed and the heart is in its most quiescent state before the next contraction.

The Zona Pellucida is a glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte (egg) that plays a crucial role in fertilization. After fertilization, the Zona Pellucida serves as a barrier that prevents polyspermy (the entry of multiple sperm into the oocyte). However, once a sperm penetrates the oocyte, the Zona Pellucida is digested, and it disappears. This process is a critical step in the development of the zygote, allowing the sperm and egg to fuse and begin the process of cell division.

Given this understanding, let's evaluate the options:

A. Before fertilisation - Incorrect, as the Zona Pellucida is still present before fertilization.
B. During fertilization - Correct, as the Zona Pellucida disappears during the process of fertilization.
C. 5th day after fertilization - Incorrect, as this is a point in the development of the zygote that occurs after the Zona Pellucida has already disappeared.

Bowel sounds are hypoactive; stool Hematest is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?","['Barium enema', 'Upper gastrointestinal series', 'Angiography', 'Ultrasonography']","Considering the patient's symptoms, including severe midabdominal pain, abdominal tenderness and distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and a positive stool Hematest, the most likely diagnosis is ischemic bowel disease (also known as mesenteric ischemia). This condition is a complication of acute myocardial infarction and can lead to bowel infarction if not promptly treated.

Given the acute presentation, the most appropriate next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of bowel involvement. While angiography (Option C) is a valuable diagnostic tool for detecting mesenteric artery occlusion, it is not the initial step in management. Ultrasonography (Option D) is not typically used for diagnosing mesenteric ischemia.

Between Options A and B, a barium enema (Option A) is more suitable for evaluating the lower gastrointestinal tract, including the colon and rectum. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms suggest upper gastrointestinal involvement.

The upper gastrointestinal series (Option B) can help evaluate the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, duodenum, and small intestine, making it the most appropriate next step in this patient's management.

410,ARDS true?,"['Type 2 respiratory failure', 'Lung compliance decreased', 'Increase in diffusion capacity', 'none']","For Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the correct answer is B. Lung compliance decreased.

ARDS is characterized by inflammation and injury to the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and difficulty breathing. One of the key features of ARDS is a decrease in lung compliance, which means that the lungs are stiffer and less able to expand. This leads to increased work of breathing and difficulty filling the lungs with air.

Type 2 respiratory failure (Option A) is a characteristic of ARDS, but it's not the only true statement. Type 2 respiratory failure is defined by hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood) and hypercapnia (elevated CO2 levels in the blood).

Increase in diffusion capacity (Option C) is not a characteristic of ARDS. In fact, the diffusion capacity of the lungs, which refers to the ability of the lungs to transfer gases across the alveolar-capillary membrane, is often decreased in ARDS due to the inflammation and injury to the lung tissue.

Ketoacidosis in diabetes mellitus typically occurs when there is a lack of insulin (due to insufficient production or insulin resistance), leading to:

1. **Increased glucagon levels**: Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In the absence of sufficient insulin, glucagon's effects on glucose production become more pronounced.
2. **Increased cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate)**: Glucagon acts through G-protein coupled receptors to increase cAMP levels, which in turn activates protein kinase A (PKA). This increases the activity of key enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, favoring gluconeogenesis and lipolysis.
3. **Increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels**: Insufficient insulin means that the body cannot effectively suppress the breakdown of fats (lipolysis), leading to increased levels of free fatty acids in the bloodstream.
4. **Hyperglycemia (increased blood glucose)**: Without enough insulin, glucose cannot enter cells efficiently, leading to high blood glucose levels.

Given these characteristics, let's examine the options:

A. **Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP and increased blood glucose**: This option accurately describes the pathophysiology of ketoacidosis in diabetes mellitus, as outlined above.
B. **Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose**: This option is partially correct but does not fully capture the role of glucagon or the implications of cAMP elevation.
C. **Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose**: This option inaccurately suggests that the blood glucose level is not elevated, which contradicts the typical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis.
D. **Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose**: This option is incorrect, as ketoacidosis in diabetes mellitus is characterized by low insulin levels, not elevated levels.

A. Melanoma: S100 is indeed used as a marker in the diagnosis of melanoma. Melanocytes, the cells from which melanoma arises, express S100 protein. So, this is not the answer.

B. Schwannoma: Schwannomas are tumors that arise from the Schwann cells, which are a type of glial cell of the nervous system. S100 is expressed by Schwann cells and is used as a marker in diagnosing schwannomas. So, this is also not the answer.

C. Histiocytoma: Histiocytomas can express S100, especially the variant known as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and the more rare Langerhans cell histiocytoma, which also expresses S100. So, this is also not the answer.

D. Basal cell cancer: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer, but it does not typically express S100. While S100 can be expressed in some rare variants or in specific patterns, it is generally not a reliable marker for BCC.

Given the information above, the correct answer is the option that involves the condition least likely to be associated with the S100 marker.

444,Pain felt between great toe and 2nd toe is due to involvement of which nerve root -,"['L5', 'S2', 'S1', 'S3']","To answer this question, let's consider the sensory distribution of the nerve roots in the lower extremity.

The L5 nerve root is responsible for the sensation in the area between the first and second toes, also known as the intermetatarsal space. This area is often referred to as the ""L5 dermatome.""

The S2 nerve root is involved in the sensation of the lateral aspect of the leg and the posterior aspect of the thigh.

The S1 nerve root is responsible for the sensation in the lateral and posterior aspect of the leg, as well as the dorsum of the foot.

The S3 nerve root is not typically associated with sensation in the foot or toe areas.

Given this information, the correct answer is the one that corresponds to the L5 nerve root, which is responsible for the sensation in the area between the great toe and the second toe.

B. Inguinal orchiectomy is indeed a part of the management, as it is the initial surgical procedure to remove the testis containing the tumor.

C. Chemotherapy is also a key component of the treatment plan, as it is often used to address the potential spread of the disease to lymph nodes and other areas.

D. Radiotherapy may also be considered in certain cases, particularly for residual or recurrent disease, but it is not the primary treatment modality for non-seminomatous testicular cancer.

A. Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND) is a surgical procedure that may be performed for certain cases of testicular cancer, but it is not typically the first line of treatment for a patient with more than 4 retroperitoneal lymph nodes involved, especially in the context of non-seminomatous testicular cancer.

446,"A 34-year-old female has a history of intermittent episodes of severe abdominal pain. She has had multiple abdominal surgeries and exploratory procedures with no abnormal findings. Her urine appears dark during an attack and gets even darker if exposed to sunlight. The attacks seem to peak after she takes erythromycin, because of her penicillin allergy. This patient most likely has difficulty in synthesizing which one of the following?","['Heme', 'Creatine phosphate', 'Cysteine', 'Thymine']","This patient's symptoms, particularly the dark urine that gets even darker when exposed to sunlight, are suggestive of Alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, an enzyme needed for the breakdown of the amino acid tyrosine. This leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid, which is a precursor in the breakdown pathway of tyrosine. Homogentisic acid is a catechol, and when it is oxidized, it forms a quinone that is responsible for the dark coloration of the urine. The fact that her urine gets even darker when exposed to sunlight suggests that the quinone is being oxidized to a more stable form when exposed to light.

The correct answer is A. Heme, because Alkaptonuria affects the breakdown of tyrosine, and tyrosine is an amino acid that is involved in the synthesis of heme. Heme is a crucial component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes, and its synthesis is dependent on the breakdown of tyrosine.

The suprarenal gland, also known as the adrenal gland, is located on top of each kidney and plays a crucial role in hormone production. Its lymphatic drainage is primarily to the lymph nodes that are nearby.

The correct answer is B. Para-aortic lymph nodes. The lymphatics of the suprarenal gland drain into the para-aortic lymph nodes, which are located near the abdominal aorta. This is the primary site for lymphatic drainage of the suprarenal glands.

The internal iliac (A) and coeliac (D) lymph nodes are involved in the lymphatic drainage of other abdominal organs, but not primarily for the suprarenal glands. The superficial inguinal (C) lymph nodes are involved in the lymphatic drainage of the lower limb and external genitalia, not the suprarenal glands.

449,Which of the following is non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase?,"['L-Alanine', 'L-Tyrosine', 'L-Tryptophan', 'L-Phenylalanine']","To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of non-competitive inhibition and the specific enzyme in question, intestinal alkaline phosphatase.

Non-competitive inhibition is a type of enzyme inhibition where the inhibitor binds to a site on the enzyme that is not the active site, changing the shape of the enzyme and affecting its ability to bind to its substrate. This type of inhibition does not change the Vmax (maximum velocity) of the enzyme reaction, but rather decreases the Km (Michaelis constant) by stabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex.

Intestinal alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found in the small intestine that breaks down phosphate groups from dietary nutrients. It is involved in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, particularly fats.

Given the options, the correct answer is D. L-Phenylalanine. L-Phenylalanine is a non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. This means that L-Phenylalanine binds to a site on the enzyme that is not the active site, changing the shape of the enzyme and reducing its activity.

CBC shows an acute effect characterized by marked leukocytosis (50,000/mL) and the differential count reveals shift to left in granulocytes. Which of the following terms best describes these hematologic findings?","['Leukemoid reaction', 'Leukopenia', 'Myeloid metaplasia', 'Neutrophilia']","To answer this question, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Patient's presentation**: The patient has a productive cough and fever, which are symptoms often associated with infections, particularly respiratory infections.
2. **Isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: This bacterium is known to cause severe infections, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems or those with underlying lung conditions.
3. **Hematologic findings**:
   - **Leukocytosis (50,000/mL)**: This indicates an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, which is a common response to infection.
   - **Shift to the left in granulocytes**: A shift to the left in the differential count means there is an increase in the number of immature granulocytes (such as band forms of neutrophils) relative to mature forms. This is a sign of bone marrow response to an infection, where the bone marrow increases production of granulocytes to combat the infection, but the cells are released before they are fully mature.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A. Leukemoid reaction**: This is a reactive process, not a true leukemia. It is characterized by a significantly elevated WBC count (usually >50,000/mL) with a predominance of mature and immature granulocytes, a result of the body's response to severe infection, inflammation, or other stressors. This matches the description given.

- **B. Leukopenia**: This is a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which is the opposite of what is described.

- **C. Myeloid metaplasia**: This term is often used to describe the presence of bone marrow cells in extramedullary sites, such as the spleen or liver. It does not describe the hematologic findings in response to infection as described here.

- **D. Neutrophilia**: While the patient does have an elevated neutrophil count, which is a form of neutrophilia, this does not fully capture the significance of the ""shift to the left"" in granulocytes, which suggests the presence of immature forms of neutrophils.

452,"All of the following can be involved in an injury to the head of the fibula, EXCEPT:","['Anterior tibial nerve', 'Common peroneal nerve', 'Superficial peroneal nerve', 'Tibial nerve']","To answer this question, let's analyze the anatomy involved.

The head of the fibula is a bony prominence located at the lateral aspect of the knee. The common peroneal nerve (B) is a branch of the sciatic nerve that wraps around the lateral aspect of the fibular head. Due to its anatomical location, the common peroneal nerve is prone to injury when the fibular head is traumatized, which can result in foot drop.

The superficial peroneal nerve (C) arises from the common peroneal nerve and is responsible for innervating the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg. Damage to the fibular head can also affect the superficial peroneal nerve.

The anterior tibial nerve (A) is not typically associated with the fibular head. Instead, it is a branch of the sciatic nerve that arises more distally and is responsible for innervating the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg.

The tibial nerve (D) is a branch of the sciatic nerve that is not typically associated with the fibular head either. It is responsible for innervating the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg.

Considering the anatomy, the correct answer is A, as the anterior tibial nerve is not typically involved in an injury to the head of the fibula.

1. Upper chest movement: This is a sign of increased respiratory effort, typically seen in respiratory distress. (1 point)
2. Minimal nasal flare: This is a sign of increased work of breathing, indicating some level of respiratory distress. (1 point)
3. Expiratory grunting: This is a classic sign of respiratory distress in infants, indicating that the baby is trying to stay alveoli open longer to increase oxygenation. (1 point)
4. No chest or xiphoid retractions: This suggests that the baby is not showing signs of significant respiratory effort, as retractions are a common sign of increased work of breathing. (0 points)

The Silverman score ranges from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe respiratory distress.

The patient should be tested for which of the following ?,"['HBV', 'HCV', 'EBV', 'Parvovious']","Based on the symptoms and laboratory findings presented, the patient is likely suffering from cryoglobulinemia, a condition characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins (cryoglobulins) in the blood that can cause inflammation and damage to blood vessels. This condition is often associated with chronic infections, particularly hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which is known to trigger the production of cryoglobulins.

The presence of monoclonal and polyclonal cryoglobulins, along with deposits of cryoglobulins around the vessels as seen in histopathology, suggests a systemic vasculitis, a condition that can be triggered by chronic infections. Given the options provided:

A. HBV (Hepatitis B virus) can also be associated with cryoglobulinemia, but HCV is more commonly linked to this condition.

464,Ulipristal acetate is a/an:,"['GnRH agonist', 'Androgen antagonist', 'Selective estrogen receptor modulator', 'Selective progesterone receptor modulator']","To answer this question, we need to identify the correct classification of Ulipristal acetate.

Ulipristal acetate is a medication that is primarily used for emergency contraception and the treatment of uterine fibroids. It works by blocking the action of the hormone progesterone, which is essential for maintaining pregnancy and regulating the menstrual cycle. By blocking progesterone receptors, ulipristal acetate prevents implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, effectively preventing pregnancy.

Considering the options:

A. GnRH agonist: GnRH agonists work by stimulating the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. This leads to a decrease in sex hormone production. Ulipristal acetate does not work in this way.

B. Androgen antagonist: Androgen antagonists block the action of androgens (male sex hormones) in the body. Ulipristal acetate does not work by blocking androgens.

C. Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM): SERMs are a class of drugs that act as estrogen receptor antagonists or agonists in various tissues of the body. While ulipristal acetate affects hormone action, it does so specifically by modulating progesterone receptors, not estrogen receptors.

D. Selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM): SPRMs are a class of drugs that act by selectively modulating the progesterone receptor. They can act as antagonists or agonists in different tissues, which is exactly how ulipristal acetate works.

The subclavian artery is responsible for supplying blood to the upper limb. In the event of a blockage at the outer border of the 1st rib, collateral circulation pathways become crucial for maintaining blood flow to the upper limb. These pathways typically involve branches of the thyrocervical trunk, the costocervical trunk, and the internal thoracic artery, which in turn supply the subclavian artery through branches like the superior thoracic artery, the suprascapular artery, and the thoracoacromial artery (which can also arise from the axillary artery but originates from branches of the subclavian artery in the case of a block).

A. Subscapular artery: This artery is not a primary collateral pathway in the event of a subclavian artery block. It arises from the axillary artery and is not directly involved in the collateral circulation that would maintain blood flow to the upper limb in the face of a subclavian block.

B. Superior thoracic artery: This is a branch of the axillary artery but can also arise from the subclavian artery. It is involved in the collateral circulation to the upper limb.

C. Thyrocervical trunk: This is a branch of the subclavian artery, and its branches (including the inferior thyroid artery, suprascapular artery, and transverse cervical artery) are involved in the collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of a block.

D. Suprascapular artery: This is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk (which itself is a branch of the subclavian artery), and it plays a role in the collateral circulation to the upper limb.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is the one that does not contribute to the collateral circulation in the event of a subclavian artery block.

468,Yoke muscle pair is,"['Rt LR and Rt MR', 'Rt so and Lt Io', 'Rt LR and Lt MR', 'All the above']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what a yoke muscle pair is.

A yoke muscle pair is a pair of eye muscles that work together to move both eyes in the same direction. In other words, when one eye muscle contracts, its ""yoke"" partner in the other eye also contracts, allowing both eyes to move together as a unit. This helps maintain binocular vision and depth perception.

Let's examine the options:

A. Rt LR and Rt MR: This pair involves the lateral rectus (LR) and medial rectus (MR) muscles in the right eye. However, the LR muscle is responsible for abduction (moving the eye outward), while the MR muscle is responsible for adduction (moving the eye inward). They do not work together to move the eye in the same direction.

B. Rt SR and Lt IR: This pair involves the superior rectus (SR) and inferior rectus (IR) muscles, but it does not specify their relationship to each other or to the movement of the eyes.

C. Rt LR and Lt MR: This pair involves the lateral rectus (LR) muscle in the right eye and the medial rectus (MR) muscle in the left eye. When the LR muscle contracts, the MR muscle contracts as its ""yoke"" partner, allowing the eyes to move outward (abduction) together.

D. All the above: Since not all the pairs listed in options A-D are correct yoke muscle pairs, this option cannot be correct.

473,index finger infection spreads to -,"['Thenar space', 'Mid palmar space', 'Hypothenar space', 'Flexion space']","To answer this question, let's consider the anatomy of the hand and the common pathways of infection spread.

The index finger is located in the radial (thumb) side of the hand. The thenar space is located on the radial side of the hand and is the potential space between the thenar muscles (thumb muscles) and the skin. Given the proximity of the index finger to the thenar muscles, an infection in the index finger is likely to spread to the thenar space.

The mid palmar space is located on the palmar surface of the hand, but it is more associated with infection spread from the middle finger. The hypothenar space is located on the ulnar (little finger) side of the hand, which is opposite to the index finger. The flexion space is not a commonly described space in relation to hand infections.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

474,"3-year-old child comes in ER with Hv'o vomiting, loose watery motion for 3 days, on examination, the child was drowsy, sunken eye. Hypothermia and skin pinch take time to revert back, diagnosis","['No dehydration', 'Mild dehydration', 'Some dehydration', 'Severe dehydration']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the symptoms presented:

1. **Hv'o vomiting**: This might be a typo for ""vomiting"", which is a symptom of dehydration.
2. **Loose watery motion for 3 days**: This indicates diarrhea, a common cause of dehydration, especially in children.
3. **Drowsy**: This is a significant sign of dehydration, as it can lead to reduced consciousness due to electrolyte imbalances.
4. **Sunken eyes**: A classic sign of dehydration, indicating fluid loss.
5. **Hypothermia**: This suggests that the body's core temperature is lower than normal, which can occur with severe dehydration due to decreased blood volume and reduced peripheral circulation.
6. **Skin pinch takes time to revert back**: This is known as skin elasticity or turgor, which is decreased in dehydration, as the skin takes longer to snap back into place after being pinched.

Given these symptoms, we can categorize the dehydration level:

- **Mild dehydration** is characterized by mild thirst, decreased urine output, and minimal weight loss. This does not match the child's presentation.
- **Some dehydration** typically involves noticeable thirst, slightly decreased urine output, and a slight decrease in skin turgor. Again, the child's symptoms are more severe than this.
- **Severe dehydration** presents with significant vomiting, diarrhea, marked thirst, decreased urine output or even no urine output, sunken eyes, and decreased skin turgor. The child's symptoms (drowsiness, hypothermia, and delayed skin pinch return) align with this category.
- **No dehydration** is clearly not the correct answer given the child's symptoms.

478,Which of the following does not cause Insulin release-,"['Rosiglitazone', 'Nateglinide', 'Glimipiride', 'Tobutamide']","To answer this question, we need to understand how each of the listed medications affects insulin release.

A. Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (TZD) that works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) in the nucleus of cells. It increases insulin sensitivity but does not directly stimulate insulin release.

B. Nateglinide is a meglitinide that stimulates insulin release by closing potassium channels in the beta cells of the pancreas, causing them to depolarize and release insulin.

C. Glimipiride (also known as glimepiride) is a sulfonylurea that also works by stimulating insulin release from the beta cells of the pancreas. It does this by binding to the SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor 1) subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the beta cells, which leads to closure of the potassium channels, depolarization of the beta cells, and subsequent insulin release.

D. Tolbutamide is another sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin release by the same mechanism as glimepiride (via the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on beta cells).

Considering the mechanism of action for each of these drugs, Rosiglitazone is the one that does not cause insulin release; it increases insulin sensitivity but does not directly stimulate insulin secretion.

The recommendation for prophylaxis in HIV-positive individuals is typically based on their CD4 cell count.

According to various clinical guidelines, including those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), prophylaxis against PCP is generally recommended for HIV-infected individuals with a CD4 count below 200 cells/mm^3.

While some guidelines may suggest starting prophylaxis at a CD4 count of 200-250 cells/mm^3 in certain situations, the most universally accepted threshold for initiating PCP prophylaxis is a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm^3.

Options A, C, and D suggest CD4 counts below 300, 100, and 50 cells/mm^3, respectively. While these counts do indicate a higher risk of opportunistic infections, they are not the standard threshold for initiating PCP prophylaxis.

A. Kayser-Fleischer ring: This is a clinical feature of chalcosis, where copper deposits accumulate in the Descemet's membrane of the cornea, forming a golden ring at the limbus.

B. Sunflower cataract: This type of cataract is indeed associated with chalcosis, where copper deposits accumulate in the lens, causing a characteristic sunflower-shaped opacity.

C. Deposition of golden plaques at the posterior pole: This is also a feature of chalcosis, where copper deposits can accumulate in the retina, particularly at the posterior pole.

D. Dalen-Fuchs nodules: These nodules are actually associated with sympathetic ophthalmia, not chalcosis. They are collections of inflammatory cells between the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane.

482,Which of the following is not a cause of glomerular proteinuria?,"['Diabetes Mellitus', 'Amyloidosis', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Nil Lesion']","To answer this question, let's go through each option and its relationship to glomerular proteinuria.

Glomerular proteinuria is characterized by the presence of protein in the urine due to damage to the glomeruli, which are the filtering units of the kidneys. This condition is often associated with diseases that affect the glomeruli directly.

A. Diabetes Mellitus: Diabetes is a well-known cause of glomerular proteinuria. The high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the glomeruli over time, leading to protein leakage into the urine. So, this option is indeed a cause of glomerular proteinuria.

B. Amyloidosis: Amyloidosis, a condition characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins (amyloid) in various tissues, including the kidneys, can cause glomerular damage and proteinuria. Thus, amyloidosis is also a cause of glomerular proteinuria.

C. Multiple Myeloma: This is a type of blood cancer that can lead to kidney damage and proteinuria. However, the primary cause of proteinuria in multiple myeloma is not glomerular but rather tubular, as the excessive light chains produced by the cancer cells can cause tubular damage and protein leakage. So, multiple myeloma is not typically a cause of glomerular proteinuria.

D. Nil Lesion: A ""nil lesion"" is a term that might be used in the context of kidney biopsy to describe a normal or essentially normal appearance of the glomeruli. Therefore, a nil lesion could be considered a cause of glomerular proteinuria in the sense that if the glomeruli are otherwise normal, the proteinuria is not due to glomerular damage.

Considering the options, the best answer is C, as multiple myeloma is not a primary cause of glomerular proteinuria.

495,CAMP acts through:,"['Activation of protein kinase', 'Activation of adenylate cyclase', 'Ca2+ release.', 'All']","To answer this question, we need to understand what CAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is and how it acts in the body.

CAMP is a secondary messenger molecule that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It is produced when adenylate cyclase, an enzyme, catalyzes the conversion of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to CAMP. CAMP then acts as a second messenger to activate various downstream pathways, one of which is the activation of protein kinase A (PKA).

PKA is a kinase enzyme that, when activated by CAMP, can phosphorylate and activate or inhibit various target proteins. This activation of PKA is a key step in the signaling pathway that CAMP mediates.

516,CSF is stored at:Kerala 11,"['4degC', '-20degC', 'Room temperature', '-70degC']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the properties of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and how it should be stored to maintain its integrity for diagnostic purposes.

CSF is a clear, colorless body fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It's essential for the central nervous system's (CNS) functioning, providing cushioning and immune protection. When collected for diagnostic testing, such as for analysis of CSF for infections, autoimmune diseases, or other neurological disorders, it's critical that the sample is handled and stored correctly to preserve its components and prevent degradation.

Option A: 4degC - This temperature is often used for storing biological samples that require refrigeration, such as blood samples, to slow down bacterial growth and enzymatic reactions. However, it might not be the optimal temperature for CSF, especially if the storage is intended for a longer period, as some components might degrade slowly at this temperature.

Option B: -20degC - This is a common temperature for storing biological samples, including some types of CSF, especially when longer-term storage is necessary. It slows down all enzymatic reactions and bacterial growth, making it suitable for preserving the integrity of most components in CSF.

Option C: Room temperature - This is not a suitable temperature for storing CSF because room temperature can foster the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms, potentially leading to contamination and degradation of the sample.

Option D: -70degC - This temperature is typically used for storing samples that require long-term preservation at very low temperatures, often for molecular biology analyses such as PCR. While it would certainly prevent degradation, it might be more than necessary for routine CSF storage unless the specific analysis requires this level of preservation.

Considering the need to balance between preventing degradation of the CSF components and the practicality of storage conditions, the most appropriate choice for storing CSF, especially if the sample needs to be preserved for a short to medium term, would be at a temperature that effectively inhibits bacterial growth and slows down enzymatic reactions without freezing the sample. Therefore, option B, storing CSF at -20degC, is the most appropriate choice given the options provided.

- Venous return to the heart increases due to gravity no longer pulling blood down towards the feet, which leads to an increase in cardiac output. However, this increase in venous return and cardiac output happens gradually, not immediately.

- Cerebral blood flow does not increase in this situation. In fact, cerebral blood flow is typically reduced in the upright position due to the effect of gravity on blood flow.

- Blood flow at the apices of the lung increases in the recumbent position, not decreases. When a person is standing, gravity causes blood to pool in the lower extremities, reducing blood flow to the lungs. When lying down, gravity no longer pulls blood down, allowing more blood to flow to the upper parts of the lungs.

- Heart rate does not necessarily increase when a person changes position from standing to lying down. However, heart rate may increase as a response to the increase in venous return and cardiac output.

533,Signal from Baroreceptors goes to -,"['Caudal ventrolateral medulla', 'Rostral dorsolateral medulla', 'Nucleus of tractus solitarius', 'None of the above']","The correct answer is C. Nucleus of tractus solitarius.

Baroreceptors are specialized sensors located in the walls of the carotid sinus and aortic arch that detect changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure increases, baroreceptors are stretched, sending a signal to the brain through the glossopharyngeal nerve (for carotid baroreceptors) and the vagus nerve (for aortic baroreceptors). These signals are received by the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brainstem, which then sends signals to the hypothalamus and other areas to decrease sympathetic tone and lower blood pressure.

534,"Neurocysticercosis is treated by all the following drugs, EXCEPT -","['Albendazole', 'Niclosamide', 'Flubendazole', 'Praziquantel']","To answer this question, let's consider the treatment options for neurocysticercosis.

Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium). The standard treatment for this condition involves antiparasitic medications.

Albendazole (Option A) is a widely used antiparasitic medication for treating neurocysticercosis. It's often given in combination with steroids to reduce inflammation.

Praziquantel (Option D) is another antiparasitic medication that's sometimes used to treat neurocysticercosis, although it's less commonly recommended than albendazole.

Now, let's consider the options that are not typically used for treating neurocysticercosis:

Niclosamide (Option B) is an antiparasitic medication, but it's primarily used to treat tapeworm infections in the gastrointestinal tract, not neurocysticercosis.

Flubendazole (Option C) is not a commonly used medication for treating neurocysticercosis. In fact, there's limited information available on its use for this condition.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

535,Which of the following vessel does not cross the midline of the body:,"['Left gonadal vein', 'Left renal vein', 'Left brachiocephalic vein', 'Hemiazygous vein']","To determine which vessel does not cross the midline of the body, let's consider the anatomy of each option:

A. Left gonadal vein: The left gonadal vein typically drains into the left renal vein, which crosses the midline. Therefore, the left gonadal vein itself does not directly cross the midline.

B. Left renal vein: The left renal vein crosses the midline to drain into the inferior vena cava (IVC) on the right side of the body.

C. Left brachiocephalic vein: The left brachiocephalic vein merges with the right brachiocephalic vein to form the superior vena cava, thus crossing the midline.

D. Hemiazygous vein: The hemiazygous vein crosses the midline to drain into the azygous vein.

Given this information, the vessel that does not cross the midline of the body is the left gonadal vein.

536,Uses of  α2 agonists are all EXCEPT:,"['To produce sedation', 'Glaucoma', 'Benign hyperplasia of prostate', 'Hypertension']","To approach this question, let's analyze the uses of α2 agonists and the options provided.

α2 agonists are a class of medications that stimulate the α2 adrenergic receptors, leading to various physiological effects. These effects include:

- Sedation: α2 agonists can produce sedation, which is why they are sometimes used in clinical settings to help patients relax or to facilitate procedures.
- Glaucoma: α2 agonists, such as brimonidine, can be used to treat glaucoma by decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing its outflow, thus lowering intraocular pressure.
- Hypertension: α2 agonists like clonidine can be used to treat hypertension. Clonidine works centrally to decrease sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system, which in turn decreases peripheral vascular resistance and heart rate, resulting in lowered blood pressure.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. To produce sedation - Correct use of α2 agonists.
B. Glaucoma - Correct use of α2 agonists.
C. Benign hyperplasia of prostate - This condition is typically treated with α1 blockers, not α2 agonists. α1 blockers relax the smooth muscle in the prostate, making it easier to urinate. α2 agonists, on the other hand, would not be effective for this purpose and could potentially worsen symptoms due to their vasoconstrictive effects.

D. Hypertension - Correct use of α2 agonists.

Given the information, the option that does not belong with the uses of α2 agonists is the treatment of benign hyperplasia of the prostate.

The formula is:

100 mL/kg/day for the first 10 kg of body weight
50 mL/kg/day for the next 10 kg of body weight
25 mL/kg/day for each kilogram over 20 kg

For a child weighing 24 kg:

For the first 10 kg: 100 mL/kg/day x 10 kg = 1000 mL/day
For the next 10 kg: 50 mL/kg/day x 10 kg = 500 mL/day
For the remaining 4 kg (24 kg - 20 kg): 25 mL/kg/day x 4 kg = 100 mL/day

538,Which is not echogenic while doing ultrasonography-,"['Bile', 'Gas', 'Bone', 'Gall stones']","When performing ultrasonography, the following substances are echogenic, meaning they produce echoes on the ultrasound image:

* Bile (A) is echogenic because it is a fluid that contains bile salts which make it more dense than surrounding tissues.
* Gas (B) is also echogenic due to the air pockets that produce strong echoes on the ultrasound image.
* Bone (C) is highly echogenic because it is a dense, calcified structure that reflects ultrasound waves strongly.
* Gallstones (D) are echogenic because they are composed of calcium salts, which are highly reflective of ultrasound waves.

However, bile is not typically considered an example of an echogenic substance in the same way that gas, bone, and gallstones are. While bile may contain echoes, it is often considered anechoic (non-echoic) or hypoechoic (less echogenic than surrounding tissues) on ultrasound images.

A. Fatty degeneration is a common finding in alcoholic liver disease, caused by the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes due to the toxic effects of alcohol on the liver.

B. Chronic hepatitis, also known as alcoholic hepatitis, is an inflammation of the liver that is caused by long-term alcohol consumption. This condition can cause scarring and cirrhosis of the liver.

D. Cholestatic hepatitis is a type of liver inflammation that can occur in people with alcoholic liver disease. It is characterized by the obstruction of bile flow, leading to the accumulation of bile in the liver.

C. Granuloma formation, on the other hand, is not typically associated with chronic alcoholism. Granulomas are aggregates of immune cells that form in response to inflammation or infection, and they are more commonly seen in conditions such as autoimmune hepatitis, sarcoidosis, or tuberculosis.

540,"Ring sideroblasts, with iron laden occurs in","['Endoplasmic reticulum', 'Nucleus', 'Mitochondria', 'Nuclear membrane']","To answer this question, we need to understand what ring sideroblasts are and where iron is stored within the cell.

Ring sideroblasts are a type of erythroblast (immature red blood cell) that contains ring-shaped accumulations of iron, which are visible as a ring of siderotic granules (iron deposits) on Prussian blue staining. This accumulation of iron is due to a defect in the mitochondria, specifically in the process of heme synthesis.

Heme synthesis occurs in the mitochondria, where the enzyme aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) is located. This enzyme is responsible for the first step in heme synthesis, and it requires iron as a cofactor. When there is a defect in the mitochondria, such as in the case of myelodysplastic syndromes or thalassemia, the mitochondria may accumulate iron, leading to the formation of ring sideroblasts.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Mitochondria.

542,"Calculate the deficit for a 60 kg person,with Hb - 5 g/dl add 1000 mg for iron stores.","['1500', '2500', '3500', '4000']","To calculate the deficit, we need to first determine the total body iron content and the current iron level.

The total body iron content for a 60 kg person is approximately 4,000 mg (or 4 grams).

The current iron level is 5 g/dl, which is below the normal range (typically 13.5-17.5 g/dl for men and 12-16 g/dl for women). 

To calculate the deficit, we need to convert the Hb level from g/dl to grams. Assuming a normal Hb level for a male (13.5 g/dl), the current Hb level is 5 g/dl, which is approximately 37% of the normal value.

Since iron is a key component of hemoglobin, we can estimate the iron deficit by calculating the amount of iron that would be needed to raise the Hb level to normal. Assuming a normal Hb level of 13.5 g/dl, the deficit can be calculated as:

Deficit = (Total body iron content - Current iron stores) + Additional iron stores needed to reach normal levels
= (4,000 mg - 0 mg (assuming current stores are depleted)) + (4,000 mg - 1,000 mg (additional stores needed to reach normal levels))
= 4,000 mg + 3,000 mg
= 7,000 mg

However, this is not among the options provided. Let's calculate the amount of iron needed to increase the Hb by 8.5 g/dl (from 5 g/dl to 13.5 g/dl) for a 60 kg person. 

Approximately 4.2 grams of iron are required per gram of Hb. 

So, for a 60 kg person, approximately 252 grams of Hb are present. 

The amount of iron needed to increase Hb by 8.5 g/dl is:

(252 g Hb x 4.2 g Fe/g Hb) / 1000 mg/g = 1061.2 mg

Adding the 1,000 mg of iron stores, we get:

1061.2 mg + 1000 mg = 2061.2 mg

However, this is still not among the options provided. Let's consider another approach.

The total body iron content is approximately 4,000 mg. If we assume that the current iron stores are depleted (i.e., 0 mg), we can estimate the deficit as follows:

Deficit = (Total body iron content - Current iron stores) + Additional iron stores needed to reach normal levels
= (4,000 mg - 0 mg) + (4,000 mg - 1,000 mg)
= 4,000 mg + 3,000 mg
= 7,000 mg

However, we know that the iron stores are not depleted, and a significant portion of the total body iron content is already present in the body.

Let's try another approach.

A commonly used formula to estimate the iron deficit is:

Deficit = (Total body iron content x Desired Hb level) / (Current Hb level)

We can plug in the values:

Deficit = (4,000 mg x 13.5 g/dl) / (5 g/dl)
Deficit = 54,000 mg / 5
Deficit = 10,800 mg

Adding the 1,000 mg of iron stores, we get:

10,800 mg + 1,000 mg = 11,800 mg

However, this is still not among the options provided.

Let's consider another formula:

Deficit = 4.2 g Hb x (Desired Hb - Current Hb) x Body weight (kg) / 1000 mg/g

We can plug in the values:

Deficit = 4.2 g Hb x (13.5 g/dl - 5 g/dl) x 60 kg / 1000 mg/g
Deficit = 4.2 g Hb x 8.5 g/dl x 60 kg / 1000 mg/g
Deficit = 20,880 mg

However, we know that this is not the correct formula.

Let's try another approach.

A commonly used formula to estimate the iron deficit is:

Deficit = 4.2 g Hb x (Desired Hb - Current Hb) x 2.3

We can plug in the values:

Deficit = 4.2 g Hb x (13.5 g/dl - 5 g/dl) x 2.3
Deficit = 4.2 g Hb x 8.5 g/dl x 2.3
Deficit = 88.38 g Hb x 2.3

Mycotic aneurysms are a type of aneurysm that occurs as a result of an infection in the arterial wall. The most common etiology is indeed bacterial endocarditis (Option A), which is a condition where bacteria infect the heart valves.

Mycotic aneurysms are typically not fusiform (Option B), but rather they are more often saccular or multilobed. Fusiform aneurysms are a type of aneurysm that affects the entire circumference of the artery, whereas mycotic aneurysms are usually localized.

Aorta and visceral vessels can indeed be affected by mycotic aneurysms (Option C), but this is not a defining characteristic.

A. Size > 5 cm: Larger adrenal tumors, especially those greater than 4 cm, have a higher likelihood of being malignant and may require surgical excision, even if they are non-functioning. Therefore, size can be an indication for surgery.

B. Bilateral adrenal metastasis: Metastases to the adrenal glands are not typically an indication for surgery, especially if they are the only sites of disease and are not causing symptoms. Treatment typically focuses on systemic therapy.

C. Functional tumor: Functional adrenal tumors, such as aldosterone-producing adenomas (Conn's syndrome) or pheochromocytomas, can cause significant hormonal imbalances leading to hypertension, hypokalemia, and other symptoms. Surgery is usually indicated for these tumors to remove the source of the hormone overproduction.

559,Nephrotic syndrome is characterised by,"['Proteinuria', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Oedema', 'All']","To approach this question, let's break down the characteristics of nephrotic syndrome:

1. **Proteinuria**: This is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome, where there is an excessive loss of protein in the urine, typically more than 3.5 grams per day. This is due to damage to the glomeruli, which normally filter waste and excess substances from the blood.

2. **Hyperlipidemia**: This condition, characterized by high levels of lipids (fats) in the blood, often accompanies nephrotic syndrome. The liver produces more lipids in response to the loss of albumin (a protein) in the urine, which is a key protein involved in lipid transport. This leads to an increase in serum lipids.

3. **Oedema**: This is a common symptom of nephrotic syndrome, resulting from the loss of albumin. Albumin helps to maintain fluid balance in the body by binding to water. Without enough albumin, fluid can leak out of the blood vessels and into the body tissues, leading to swelling (oedema), particularly in the legs and feet.

Given these characteristics, nephrotic syndrome involves all three symptoms mentioned: proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), hyperlipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood), and oedema (swelling due to fluid loss).

596,Pseudo pocket is seen in the,"['Base of the pocket lies on cementum', 'Gingivitis', 'Periodontitis', 'Base of the pocket and lies on alveolar bone']","To answer this question, let's break down the definition of a pseudo pocket and the options provided.

A pseudo pocket is a term used in periodontics to describe a phenomenon where the gingival margin appears to be deeper than the actual pocket depth. This occurs due to the gingival tissue being displaced apically (towards the root) or the gingival margin being uneven, rather than an actual deepened pocket.

Given this definition, let's look at the options:

A. Base of the pocket lies on cementum - This option describes a true pocket, where the base of the pocket is on the cementum (the layer covering the root of the tooth).

B. Gingivitis - This option is a condition, not a description of a pocket's characteristics.

C. Periodontitis - Like option B, this is a condition, not a description of a pocket's characteristics.

D. Base of the pocket and lies on alveolar bone - This option is similar to option A, describing a true pocket where the base is on the alveolar bone.

Considering the definition of a pseudo pocket, the best description given in the options is that the base of the pocket lies on cementum, which aligns with the characteristic of a pseudo pocket being a phenomenon where the gingival margin appears to be deeper due to displacement, but the base of the pocket is actually on the cementum. However, it's essential to note that a pseudo pocket is more about the appearance and the mechanism behind it rather than the base of the pocket being on cementum. The description given in option A best fits the description of a pseudo pocket in the context of the provided options, despite the slight mismatch in the explanation.

A. Lagophthalmos: This condition refers to an inability to completely close the eyelids, resulting in an incomplete closure of the palpebral aperture. This is the correct condition mentioned in the question.

B. Chalazion: A chalazion is a small bump on the eyelid caused by a blockage of a sebaceous gland. It's not directly related to the closure of the eyelid.

C. Entropion: This condition involves the eyelid rolling inward, which can cause the eyelashes to rub against the cornea. While it can cause discomfort and vision problems, it doesn't directly relate to the incomplete closure of the palpebral aperture.

D. Ectropion: Ectropion is a condition where the eyelid turns outward, often leading to exposure of the conjunctiva. Like entropion, it's more about the position of the eyelid rather than its closure.

Given these descriptions, the correct answer to the question is the condition that directly involves the incomplete closure of the palpebral aperture.

601,The following infection resembles malignancy -,"['Echinococcus granulosus', 'E. multilocularis', 'E.vogeli', 'E. oligarthus']","To answer this question, let's analyze each option:

A. Echinococcus granulosus is a parasitic tapeworm that causes cystic echinococcosis (also known as hydatid disease). The disease typically presents as a cystic lesion, but it can be treated with surgical removal of the cyst.

B. E. multilocularis is a parasitic tapeworm that causes alveolar echinococcosis. This infection is more aggressive and can resemble a malignancy, as it can infiltrate and damage surrounding tissues, leading to the formation of multiple small nodules or ""alveoli"" that can spread and cause significant morbidity if left untreated.

C. E. vogeli is another parasitic tapeworm that causes polycystic echinococcosis. It is less common than E. granulosus and E. multilocularis, and its presentation and behavior are not typically as aggressive as E. multilocularis.

D. E. oligarthus is not a recognized species of Echinococcus, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

603,"In a family, the father has widely spaced eyes, increased facial hair and deafness. One of the three children has deafness with similar facial features. The mother is normal. Which one of the following is most likely pattern of inheritance in this case?","['Autosomal dominant', 'Autosomal recessive', 'X-linked dominant', 'X-linked recessive']","Given the information provided, the father has the symptoms of Treacher Collins syndrome, which is a condition characterized by widely spaced eyes, increased facial hair, and deafness. The fact that one of the three children has the same symptoms suggests that the mother is a carrier of the mutated gene.

In X-linked recessive inheritance, the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y chromosome. In X-linked recessive inheritance, the condition is more common in males because they have only one X chromosome. If the mother is a carrier of the mutated gene, there is a 50% chance that each son will inherit the mutated gene and express the condition. However, daughters who inherit the mutated gene will usually be carriers, like their mother.

Since the father has the condition, and one of the three children has the same condition, and the mother is normal, it suggests that the mother is likely a carrier of the mutated gene, which is a characteristic of X-linked recessive inheritance.

A. His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis: 
This statement is accurate. A household contact of a child with active tuberculosis (TB) who is less than 4 years old should receive isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis to prevent the development of TB disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends INH prophylaxis for children under 4 years old exposed to a child with TB disease.

B. A baseline test of auditory function test is essential before drug treatment is initiated:
This statement is not accurate for this specific scenario. A baseline test of auditory function is essential before initiating certain medications, such as streptomycin, which can cause ototoxicity. However, ethambutol, one of the medications the boy is taking, can cause optic neuritis (not auditory dysfunction) as a side effect, requiring a baseline visual acuity test, not an auditory function test.

C. Polyarthralgia is a potential adverse effect of the drugs the boy is taking:
This statement is not accurate. Polyarthralgia (joint pain) is not commonly associated with the medications used to treat TB (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol). Common side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances (such as nausea and vomiting), hepatotoxicity, and, as mentioned, with ethambutol, optic neuritis.

D. His mother, who takes care of him, does not need INH prophylaxis:
This statement is not accurate. The mother, as a household contact of the child with active TB, should receive INH prophylaxis to prevent the development of TB disease. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all household members of a child with active TB receive INH prophylaxis.

607,All of the following are seen in GH deficiency except?,"['Hyperglycemia', 'Stunting', 'Delayed bone age', 'High pitched voice']","To approach this question, let's consider the effects of Growth Hormone (GH) deficiency.

GH plays a crucial role in regulating growth and development, particularly during childhood and adolescence. It stimulates the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which promotes the growth of bones and other tissues.

Now, let's examine the options:

B. Stunting: GH deficiency leads to growth retardation and stunting, so this option is consistent with GH deficiency.

C. Delayed bone age: GH deficiency can also lead to delayed bone age, which means that the bones of an individual with GH deficiency are smaller and less developed than those of a similar-aged individual without GH deficiency. This option is also consistent with GH deficiency.

D. High pitched voice: Children with GH deficiency often have delayed growth and development, including delayed closure of the epiphyseal plates, delayed puberty, and delayed changes in voice, which can result in a high-pitched voice. So, this option is also consistent with GH deficiency.

A. Hyperglycemia: GH actually has a role in regulating glucose metabolism, and GH deficiency typically leads to hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia. GH stimulates gluconeogenesis and lipolysis, which can help increase blood glucose levels.

Therefore, the correct answer is the option that is not consistent with GH deficiency.

608,"The tendon of Sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus muscles forms a Pes Anserinus at the neck of tibia. Similar kind of structure is also seen in?","['Parotid', 'Submandibular', 'Cheek', 'TMJ']","To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of ""Pes Anserinus"". Pes Anserinus is a Latin phrase meaning ""goose foot"", referring to a structure formed by tendons that converge and insert together at a single point. In the case of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus muscles, they converge at the anteromedial aspect of the tibia, forming a Pes Anserinus.

The question is asking for a similar structure to be found in another part of the body.

The correct answer can be deduced by analyzing the options:

A. Parotid: The parotid gland is located near the ear and has a structure called the ""parotid plexus"", but it is not directly related to a ""Pes Anserinus"" type structure.

B. Submandibular: The submandibular gland has a duct that empties into the submandibular triangle, forming a ""whip-like"" structure called the ""Wharton's duct"", which resembles the convergence of tendons forming a ""Pes Anserinus"".

C. Cheek: The cheek does not have a specific structure that resembles a ""Pes Anserinus"".

D. TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint): The TMJ does not have a structure that resembles a ""Pes Anserinus"".

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Submandibular, because Wharton's duct in the submandibular gland forms a similar type of convergence of structures, similar to the Pes Anserinus at the neck of the tibia.

Which of the following is the most likely organism?","['Corynebacterium diphtheriae', 'Streptococcus group C', 'Neisseria gonorrhoeae', 'Streptococcus group A']","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the clinical presentation and match them to the possible causes.

1. **Sudden onset of high fever and hypotension**: This suggests a severe systemic infection, possibly sepsis.
2. **Generalized erythematous macular rash**: This is indicative of a diffuse infection that is likely bacterial in nature.
3. **Development of gangrene**: This suggests a condition that impairs blood flow or causes severe vascular compromise, often seen in septic conditions.

Considering these symptoms, the most likely organism should be one that causes severe systemic infection (sepsis), can lead to gangrene, and has a rash as part of its clinical presentation.

- **Option A (Corynebacterium diphtheriae)**: Typically causes diphtheria, which has a membrane-like covering on the tonsils or throat, not gangrene or the described rash.
- **Option B (Streptococcus group C)**: While it can cause severe infections, it's not commonly associated with the rash described or gangrene in this manner.
- **Option C (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)**: Known for causing gonorrhea, it can cause a rash but is not typically associated with gangrene or the described severe systemic symptoms.
- **Option D (Streptococcus group A)**: This organism can cause severe infections, including necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease), which is characterized by rapid progression to necrosis of skin and soft tissues, leading to gangrene. It's also associated with a rash and can cause severe systemic symptoms including sepsis.

Given the clinical presentation of gangrene, severe systemic symptoms (fever, hypotension), and rash, the most likely cause is **necrotizing fasciitis**, which is often caused by **Streptococcus group A**.

The child was also very irritable. What is your diagnosis?,"['Albinism', 'Phenylketonuria', 'Alkaptonuria', 'Cystinosis']","To approach this question, let's consider the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Delayed milestones**: This suggests a neurological or developmental issue.
2. **Fair skin, hypopigmented hair, and blue eyes**: These features suggest a condition affecting pigmentation.
3. **Eczema**: Indicates a possible allergic component or a condition affecting the skin.
4. **Irritability**: Can be associated with various conditions, including neurological issues or metabolic disorders.

Let's analyze the options:

- **A. Albinism**: Primarily affects pigmentation, leading to fair skin, hair, and eyes, but it doesn't directly explain the developmental delay or eczema.
- **B. Phenylketonuria (PKU)**: A metabolic disorder caused by the inability to break down phenylalanine, leading to its accumulation. It can cause developmental delay, skin problems (including eczema), and if untreated, severe neurological damage. The blue eyes and fair skin can be indirect effects of the condition, as individuals with untreated PKU may have lighter skin and hair due to decreased melanin production.
- **C. Alkaptonuria**: A genetic disorder resulting from the inability to break down homogentisic acid. It leads to dark urine, joint problems, and ochronosis (pigmentation of cartilage and other tissues), but it doesn't directly explain the developmental delay or the specific combination of symptoms described.
- **D. Cystinosis**: A metabolic disorder affecting the kidneys and eyes. It leads to a buildup of cystine within cells, causing problems in these organs, but it's less commonly associated with the specific combination of symptoms like eczema and developmental delay.

Given the combination of developmental delay, eczema, fair skin, and blue eyes, the most fitting diagnosis is **B. Phenylketonuria**. It's a metabolic disorder that can explain the delayed milestones, skin problems, and the described pigmentation changes, making it the most logical choice.

A. High WBC count: Generally, a high white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis is associated with a poorer prognosis in ALL. Therefore, option A is not a good prognostic factor.

B. Male sex: In the context of ALL, being female is often associated with a better prognosis, while being male is associated with a poorer prognosis. Thus, option B is not correct.

C. Age < 2 years: Children with ALL diagnosed at an age less than 1 year (infants) have a poorer prognosis compared to children diagnosed between 1 and 10 years of age. While age does play a role in prognosis, being under 2 years is not typically considered a good prognostic factor.

D. Hyperdiploidy: Hyperdiploidy, or having more than 50 chromosomes in leukemia cells, is indeed a good prognostic factor in children with ALL.

A. This option mentions the opening of calcium channels, leading to an increase in Ca²⁺, which is a crucial step in the contraction of smooth muscle cells. When a nerve impulse reaches a smooth muscle cell, it causes the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing an influx of calcium ions into the cell. This increase in intracellular calcium triggers muscle contraction. Therefore, option A accurately describes the process.

B. This option refers to the depolarization of the plasma membrane and T-tubules, which is more relevant to the contraction of skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, the T-tubules play a key role in the transmission of the action potential to the interior of the muscle fiber, where it triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is not directly relevant to the initiation of smooth muscle contraction.

C. This option mentions the inhibition of Na⁺ entry in the sarcomere, which is not directly related to the initiation of smooth muscle contraction. The entry of sodium ions into the cell does not play a significant role in the contraction of smooth muscle cells.

D. This option refers to the binding of acetylcholine to receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is more relevant to the contraction of skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, acetylcholine binds to receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, triggering the release of calcium ions, which then initiate muscle contraction. While acetylcholine is involved in the contraction of smooth muscle, it does so by binding to receptors on the smooth muscle cell itself, not in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

616,Drug NOT used in pulmonary hypeension is?,"['Calcium channel blocker', 'Endothelin receptor antagonist', 'Alpha blocker', 'Prostacyclin']","To answer this question, we need to consider the treatment options for pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart. Treatment options typically involve medications that help reduce blood pressure, improve oxygen levels, and alleviate symptoms.

Let's examine the options:

A. Calcium channel blockers: These are used in certain cases of pulmonary hypertension, particularly when the underlying cause is related to calcium channel blockers (e.g., primary pulmonary hypertension). They work by relaxing blood vessels and reducing blood pressure.

B. Endothelin receptor antagonists: These are a class of medications specifically used to treat pulmonary hypertension. They block the action of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor that contributes to high blood pressure in the lungs.

D. Prostacyclin: This is a type of vasodilator that is often used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, especially in more severe cases. It helps to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow in the lungs.

Now, let's consider option C: Alpha blockers. Alpha blockers are a class of medications that block the action of alpha receptors, which are involved in vasoconstriction (blood vessel constriction). While alpha blockers are used in various conditions, such as hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, they are not typically used to treat pulmonary hypertension.

A. Pantothenate kinase deficiency, also known as Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN), is a form of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). The hallmark of PKAN is a ""eye-of-the-tiger"" sign on MRI, which is not described as tigroid white matter.

B. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a genetic disorder affecting the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by a mutation in the gene encoding proteolipid protein (PLP), leading to a breakdown in the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers. Tigroid white matter, which appears as a marbled or striated pattern on MRI, is a classic radiological feature of PMD due to the abnormal myelination.

C. Neuroferritinopathy is a condition where there's an accumulation of iron in the brain due to mutations in the ferritin gene. While it does lead to iron accumulation in the brain, the characteristic imaging finding is not tigroid white matter but rather increased signal on MRI due to iron deposition, particularly in the globus pallidus.

D. Aceruloplasminemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of iron in various organs, including the brain. The imaging hallmark is increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra due to iron accumulation, not tigroid white matter.

Based on this reasoning, the condition associated with tigroid white matter on MRI is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.

A hydatidiform mole, also known as a molar pregnancy, is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It occurs when there is an abnormal development of the placenta, often due to a genetic issue. There are two main types of hydatidiform moles: complete and partial.

- **Complete moles** arise from the fertilization of an empty egg by one sperm, which then duplicates its DNA to form a placenta without a fetus. Histologically, this is characterized by hydropic degeneration of the villous stroma, where the villi (small projections of the placenta) are filled with fluid and expand, giving a characteristic ""bunch of grapes"" appearance.

- **Partial moles** occur when there is an abnormal fertilization involving two sperm or one sperm and an extra egg, leading to a mixture of normal and abnormal cells in the placenta. This is not typically described as having hydropic degeneration of the villous stroma as a defining characteristic.

Considering the options provided:
- **A. Hyaline membrane degeneration** is more commonly associated with the placenta in conditions not directly related to hydatidiform moles.
- **B. Hydropic degeneration of the villous stroma** is the correct histological feature that characterizes hydatidiform mole, particularly complete mole.
- **C. Non proliferation of cytotrophoblasts** is not a defining characteristic of hydatidiform mole. In fact, there is usually an overgrowth of trophoblastic cells in moles.
- **D. Non proliferation of syncytiotrophoblasts** is also not characteristic. The syncytiotrophoblasts are typically overgrown in moles.

621,The relationship of mean height of two group of children is best studied by-,"[""Student's test"", 'Linear regression', 'Chi-square test', 'Test of propoions']","To determine the relationship between the mean height of two groups of children, we need to compare the means of the two groups. This is a scenario where we want to know if there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.

The correct statistical test for comparing the means of two groups is the Student's t-test (also known as the independent samples t-test). This test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two independent groups.

Linear regression (B) is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, but it's not the best choice for comparing means.

The Chi-square test (C) is used for categorical data, which doesn't apply to this scenario since we're dealing with continuous data (mean heights).

The Test of proportions (D) is used to compare the proportion of categorical data between two groups, which is not relevant to this scenario.

624,The most impoant prognostic factor of Wilms tumor-,"['Histopathology', 'Ploidy of cells', 'Age < 1 y', 'Mutation of c 1p gene']","For Wilms tumor, the most important prognostic factor is the histopathology of the tumor. The histopathology determines the risk category of the tumor, which in turn guides the treatment and predicts the outcome. The National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS) uses the following histopathological risk categories:

1. Favourable histology (FH): This includes tumors with blastema-rich, epithelial, and/or stromal components.
2. Anaplastic histology (An): This includes tumors with a high degree of cellular anaplasia and pleomorphism.
3. Bilineal (BL): This includes tumors with both favourable and anaplastic components.

The NWTS risk-based approach categorizes patients into three risk groups: standard-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk. The risk category is primarily determined by the histopathology of the tumor.

The other options, ploidy of cells (B), age < 1 y (C), and mutation of c 1p gene (D), are not the most important prognostic factors for Wilms tumor.

Which is the test to monitor response to treatment?","['VDRL', 'FTA ABS', 'TPI', 'RPR']","To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and treatment history. 

The patient initially presented with penile ulcers, which suggests a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The most common cause of penile ulcers is syphilis. 

Later, the patient presented with neurological symptoms, which is a known complication of syphilis if left untreated. This suggests that the patient had syphilis, which was treated.

The question asks for the test to monitor the response to treatment. 

- VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test) is a non-treponemal test for syphilis, which is used for screening and monitoring the response to treatment. A decrease in VDRL titers indicates a good response to treatment.

- FTA ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption test) is a treponemal test, which detects antibodies against the bacterium that causes syphilis. These tests are used for diagnosis, but not for monitoring response to treatment.

- TPI (Treponema pallidum immobilization test) is another treponemal test, which is used for diagnosis, but not for monitoring response to treatment.

- RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin test) is another non-treponemal test, similar to VDRL. It is also used for screening and monitoring the response to treatment.

Given the options, the best answer is A, as VDRL is the test used to monitor the response to treatment for syphilis.

A. Can-opener capsulotomy: This is a method of creating a circular opening in the anterior capsule of the lens. However, it's an older technique and not the most widely used or preferred method in phacoemulsification.

B. Intercapsular capsulotomy: This technique involves making a radial cut in the anterior capsule, then extending the cut around the equator of the lens. It's not the most common method used in phacoemulsification.

C. Capsulorhexis: This is a technique used in phacoemulsification where a circular opening is created in the anterior capsule. It's a precise method that allows for the safe and efficient removal of the lens. Capsulorhexis is known for its stability and is less likely to lead to posterior capsule rupture.

D. Envelop capsulotomy: This method involves making a series of small radial cuts in the anterior capsule and then extending a circular cut around the lens. It's not as commonly used as capsulorhexis.

Local anesthetics work by blocking the sodium channels in the neuronal membrane, which prevents the initiation and propagation of action potentials. This blockade is more effective on stimulated nerves, as the anesthetic can bind to the sodium channels when they are open (i.e., during the depolarized state of the action potential). Therefore, option A is incorrect because local anesthetics have a greater potential to block stimulated nerves, not resting nerves.

Local anesthetics must cross the cell membrane to produce their effect, as they are hydrophobic and can pass through the lipid bilayer. Once inside the cell, they bind to the sodium channels and block their activity. Therefore, option B is correct.

Local anesthetics typically block small, unmyelinated fibers before large, myelinated fibers. This is because small fibers have a higher density of sodium channels per unit length and are more susceptible to blockade by local anesthetics. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Finally, local anesthetics cause a consistent depolarization of the resting membrane potential, known as a depolarizing block. This is because the blockade of sodium channels prevents the repolarization of the membrane, leading to a persistent depolarization. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

657,All of the following are true for retinopathy of prematurity except:,"['Occurs in premature infants due to late crying', 'Due to hypoxia there occurs neovascularization followed by fibroproliferation', 'End result is bilateral blindness', 'Blindness can be prevented by early diagnosis and ablation of vascular premature retina with cryotherapy or photocoagulation']","To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP):

A. Retinopathy of prematurity is a disease that occurs in premature infants, but it is not specifically caused by late crying. Instead, it is related to the immaturity of the retina and the infant's exposure to high levels of oxygen, which can lead to abnormal blood vessel growth. So, this option is not accurate.

B. Hypoxia (low oxygen levels) can indeed lead to neovascularization (the growth of new blood vessels) and fibroproliferation (the formation of fibrous tissue and abnormal blood vessels) in the retina of premature infants. This is a key aspect of the pathophysiology of ROP, making this option true.

C. One of the potential outcomes of untreated ROP is blindness, which can be bilateral (affecting both eyes). Therefore, this option is true.

D. Early diagnosis and treatment of ROP can indeed prevent blindness. This is done through ablative therapies such as laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy, which destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This option is also true.

Given the above analysis, the statement that stands out as not true for retinopathy of prematurity is option A, which incorrectly suggests that late crying is a cause of the condition.

658,A six year old male baby presents to a hospital with recurrent gross hematuria for 2 years. There is no h/o burning micturition or pyuria. Urine routine examination demonstrated no pus cells and urine culture was sterile. Serum C3 levels were normal. What is the most probable diagnosis-,"[""Wilm's tumour"", 'IgA nephropathy', 'Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis', 'Urinaiy tract infection']","Based on the given information, the most probable diagnosis is A. Wilm's tumor.

Wilm's tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a type of cancer that primarily affects children, with a peak incidence between the ages of 2 and 5 years. It can cause gross hematuria, which is the presence of blood in the urine, without any other symptoms such as burning micturition or pyuria (pus in the urine). The normal serum C3 levels and sterile urine culture also rule out post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and urinary tract infection, respectively. IgA nephropathy is a condition that typically presents with episodic hematuria following an upper respiratory tract infection, which is not mentioned in the scenario.

660,Patient on treatment on carbidopa + levodopa for 10 yrs now has weaning off effect. What should be added to restore action -,"['Tolcapone', 'Amantadine', 'Rasagiline', 'Benzhexol']","To address this question, let's break down the scenario and options provided.

The patient has been on carbidopa + levodopa for 10 years and is now experiencing a weaning-off effect. This effect is due to the development of dyskinesia and the diminishing effectiveness of levodopa over time. The goal is to restore the action of levodopa.

Option A, Tolcapone, is a COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) inhibitor. By inhibiting COMT, Tolcapone increases the levels of levodopa in the brain, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of carbidopa + levodopa. This is particularly useful in managing the wearing-off effect associated with long-term levodopa therapy.

Option B, Amantadine, is primarily used for its antiviral and antiparkinsonian properties. It can be used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease but is not specifically indicated for the weaning-off effect of levodopa.

Option C, Rasagiline, is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor. It can be used as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease but is not typically added to levodopa to address the weaning-off effect.

Option D, Benzhexol (Trihexyphenidyl), is an anticholinergic used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms but not specifically for the weaning-off effect of levodopa.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate choice to restore the action of carbidopa + levodopa is the addition of a COMT inhibitor to increase the levels of levodopa in the brain.

662,A 6 years child has foreign body in trachea .Best initial management is,"[""Heimlich's maneuver"", 'Cardiac massage', 'Intubation', 'Oxygen mask with IPPV']","The correct answer is A. Heimlich's maneuver.

Heimlich's maneuver is a first aid procedure used to relieve a foreign body obstruction in the airway, such as a piece of food or an object that has become stuck in the trachea. This is the recommended initial management for a child with a foreign body in the trachea, as it can help to dislodge the object and restore breathing.

Intubation (C) may be necessary if the Heimlich's maneuver is unsuccessful, but it is not the initial management.

Cardiac massage (B) is not relevant to the management of a foreign body in the trachea.

Oxygen mask with IPPV (D) may be used to provide supplemental oxygen and support breathing, but it does not address the underlying cause of the obstruction.

663,Position of wrist in cast of colle's fracture is:,"['Palmar detion & pronation', 'Palmar detion & supination', 'Dorsal detion & pronation', 'Dorsal detion & supination']","To answer this question, let's consider the goal of a Colles' fracture treatment, which is to restore the natural alignment and function of the wrist. A Colles' fracture is a break in the distal part of the radius bone in the forearm, typically occurring when a person falls onto an outstretched hand.

The primary aim when casting a Colles' fracture is to maintain the wrist in a position that allows for proper healing and minimizes the risk of complications, such as nerve damage or malunion. This position is typically one that reduces the fracture and allows the wrist to be in a neutral or slightly flexed position to ensure proper alignment of the fracture fragments.

Option A: Palmar detion & pronation is incorrect because palmar detion (or flexion) and pronation would not typically be the preferred position for immobilizing a Colles' fracture, as pronation can lead to further displacement of the fracture.

Option B: Palmar detion & supination is also incorrect for a similar reason. While supination (rotation of the forearm so the palm faces upwards) is not inherently problematic, palmar detion (flexion) in a Colles' fracture is not ideal as it can lead to increased pressure on the fracture site, potentially causing malunion.

Option C: Dorsal detion & pronation might seem reasonable at first glance because it reduces the fracture and maintains pronation. However, dorsal detion (or extension) is the preferred position for immobilizing a Colles' fracture, not palmar detion.

Option D: Dorsal detion & supination is the correct answer. Dorsal detion (or extension) is the preferred position for immobilizing a Colles' fracture. This position reduces the fracture and allows the wrist to be in a neutral or slightly extended position, which helps to ensure proper alignment of the fracture fragments. Supination (rotation of the forearm so the palm faces upwards) is also recommended as it helps to reduce the risk of nerve damage.

664,The number of line angles in a permanent maxillary central incisor is,"['Two', 'Four', 'Six', 'Eight']","To answer this question, let's consider the anatomy of a permanent maxillary central incisor. Line angles are formed by the intersection of two surfaces of a tooth. A maxillary central incisor has five surfaces: mesial, distal, labial, palatal, and incisal (chipping). Each of these surfaces intersects with another surface, creating line angles.

The mesial surface intersects with the labial surface, the palatal surface, and the incisal surface, creating three line angles. The distal surface intersects with the labial surface, the palatal surface, and the incisal surface, creating another three line angles. The labial surface intersects with the mesial surface, the distal surface, and the incisal surface, creating three more line angles. The palatal surface intersects with the mesial surface, the distal surface, and the incisal surface, creating three more line angles. Finally, the incisal surface intersects with the mesial surface, the distal surface, and the labial surface, creating three line angles.

However, some of these line angles are shared (for example, the line angle created by the intersection of the mesial and incisal surfaces is also the line angle created by the intersection of the distal and incisal surfaces). When we remove the shared line angles, we are left with a total of 6 unique line angles.

A. Abnormal oral glucose tolerance in a 24-yrs-old woman who has been dieting: This option is not specific or definitive for diagnosing diabetes mellitus, as dieting can affect glucose tolerance, and a single abnormal test result is not enough to confirm the diagnosis.

B. Successive fasting plasma glucose concentrations of 8, 9, and 8.5 mmol/L in an asymptomatic, otherwise healthy businesswoman: According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus can be made if a person has a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/L or higher on two separate occasions. This option meets this criterion.

C. A serum glucose level >7.8 mmol/L in a woman in her twenty-fifth week of gestation after a 50-g oral glucose load: The criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus are different from those for diabetes mellitus in the general population. A 50-g oral glucose challenge test (GCT) with a result of 7.8 mmol/L or higher indicates a risk of gestational diabetes but does not confirm the diagnosis. A 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) would be required to confirm the diagnosis.

D. Persistent asymptomatic glycosuria in a 30-yrs-old woman: Glycosuria can be caused by various factors, including diabetes mellitus, but it is not a definitive diagnostic criterion. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus requires a specific plasma glucose concentration, as mentioned above.

667,Buerger waves (alpha waves) of EEG have the rhythm per sec of -,"['0-4', '7-Apr', '13-Aug', '13-30']","To answer this question, I need to understand what Buerger waves (also known as alpha waves) are and their typical frequency range.

Alpha waves are a type of brain wave that are typically observed in a relaxed but alert state. They are most commonly seen in the posterior regions of the brain. The frequency range of alpha waves is generally considered to be between 8 and 12 Hz.

Given the options, the closest match to this frequency range is:

B. 7-Apr

However, considering the typical range of alpha waves, I would expect the correct answer to be even more specific, with a lower frequency. Since the option is B. 7-Apr, which seems to be a typographical error and likely should be 7-14 Hz, this would be the closest match, considering the standard range of alpha waves is typically reported to be between 8-12 Hz, which falls within the 7-14 Hz range provided in option B.

A. No fade on Train of four stimulation: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, which typically does not exhibit fade on train-of-four stimulation. This is a characteristic of depolarizing agents, so option A is true.

B. Fade on tetanic stimulation: Depolarizing agents like succinylcholine characteristically show fade on tetanic stimulation. This is a hallmark of depolarizing block, making option B true.

C. No post tetanic facilitation: Post tetanic facilitation is a phenomenon where the muscle response to a tetanic stimulus is greater than expected, often seen in conditions of partial neuromuscular blockade or with certain types of neuromuscular blocking agents. Succinylcholine, as a depolarizing agent, does not typically exhibit post tetanic facilitation, making option C true.

D. Train of four ratio > 0.4: A train-of-four ratio greater than 0.4 typically indicates minimal to no neuromuscular block, suggesting that the neuromuscular junction is functioning normally. This is not characteristic of succinylcholine's effect, which would reduce the train-of-four ratio below 0.4, indicating neuromuscular block. Therefore, option D is the statement that is not true for succinylcholine.

672,Terminal axillary draining lymph nodes -,"['Anterior', 'Posterior', 'Scapular', 'Apical']","To answer this question, we need to know about the lymphatic drainage of the breast. 

The breast receives lymphatic drainage from the axilla. The axillary lymph nodes are divided into three levels based on their relationship to the pectoralis minor muscle. The levels of axillary lymph nodes are further divided into groups based on their location.

The question asks for the ""Terminal axillary draining lymph nodes."" This implies the last set of lymph nodes in the axilla through which lymph passes before it is sent to the next group of nodes or to the rest of the body.

The correct answer is D. Apical. 
The apical nodes are located at the apex of the axilla, above the pectoralis minor muscle. They are the terminal nodes for the axillary lymphatic drainage. Lymph from all other groups of axillary lymph nodes ultimately drains to the apical nodes before it is sent to the central lymph nodes and further on to the thoracic duct, which drains to the bloodstream.

Which of the following can occur as a result of nerve injury,"['Loss of sensation of lateral foot', 'Loss of sensation of adjacent sides of 1st & 2nd toe', 'Inversion inability', 'Loss of dorsiflexion']","The peroneal nerve, also known as the common peroneal nerve, wraps around the head of the fibula and is susceptible to injury in this area. The peroneal nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles that dorsiflex the foot (elevate the foot upwards) and evert the foot (rotate the foot outward).

Given the options:

A. Loss of sensation of lateral foot - The peroneal nerve does carry sensory fibers from the lateral aspect of the lower leg and foot, but this is not the most specific consequence of a peroneal nerve injury in this context.

B. Loss of sensation of adjacent sides of 1st & 2nd toe - This is not typically associated with a peroneal nerve injury. The sensation to the 1st and 2nd toes is primarily carried by the deep peroneal nerve, which is a branch of the peroneal nerve but is not the main nerve affected when the peroneal nerve is injured around the fibula.

C. Inversion inability - Inversion of the foot is controlled by the tibialis posterior muscle, which is innervated by the tibial nerve (a branch of the sciatic nerve), not the peroneal nerve. This option is incorrect because the peroneal nerve injury would not lead to an inability to invert the foot.

D. Loss of dorsiflexion - The peroneal nerve innervates the muscles that are responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot (e.g., the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, and extensor hallucis longus muscles). Damage to this nerve could result in an inability to dorsiflex the foot, making this the most appropriate answer.

A. Thyroglossal cyst: This type of cyst is usually located along the midline of the neck and is associated with the hyoid bone. It typically moves upward with swallowing due to its attachment to the tongue and hyoid bone.

B. Thyroid swelling: The thyroid gland is located in the anterior part of the neck and is also attached to the larynx and hyoid bone. Therefore, it tends to move upward with swallowing.

C. Branchial cyst: This type of cyst arises from remnants of the branchial clefts and can be located in the anterior or posterior part of the neck. It does not have a direct attachment to the hyoid bone or larynx, so it does not typically move with swallowing.

D. Tuberculous lymph nodes: These can be located in various parts of the body, including the neck, and can cause swelling. However, their movement with swallowing is not a characteristic feature.

B. Placenta previa: Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. It is more common in women who have had multiple pregnancies, as the risk increases with each subsequent pregnancy. Thus, this option is also more common in multipara.

C. PIH (Pregnancy-induced Hypertension): PIH, also known as gestational hypertension, can occur in any pregnancy. However, its risk does not significantly increase with multiple pregnancies compared to primipara. In fact, the risk of developing PIH can be influenced by various factors, including age, previous history of hypertension, and multiple gestations, but it is not more common in multipara compared to primipara in the context of this question.

Three months ago he was diagnosed with hypeension, and placed on antihypeensive medication. Which of the following medications was most likely prescribed?","['Captopril', 'Furosemide', 'Hydrochlorothiazide', 'Spironolactone']","To solve this question, let's break down the information and analyze the options.

The patient presents with a substantial increase in the size of his breasts, which is a symptom known as gynecomastia. Gynecomastia can be caused by an imbalance of estrogen and testosterone in the body, which can be triggered by certain medications.

The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and placed on antihypertensive medication. This suggests that we are looking for a medication that is commonly prescribed for high blood pressure.

Now, let's examine the options:

A. Captopril: This is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, commonly used to treat high blood pressure. While it can have side effects, gynecomastia is not typically associated with captopril.

B. Furosemide: This is a diuretic, used to treat fluid build-up caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or a kidney disorder. Furosemide is not typically associated with gynecomastia.

C. Hydrochlorothiazide: This is a thiazide diuretic, commonly used to treat high blood pressure. While thiazide diuretics can cause various side effects, gynecomastia is not typically a common side effect.

D. Spironolactone: This is a potassium-sparing diuretic, commonly used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Importantly, spironolactone is known to cause gynecomastia due to its anti-androgenic effects.

Given the patient's symptoms and the medication options, the most likely prescribed medication is the one known to cause gynecomastia.

700,50 year old male with positive family history of prostate cancer has come to you for a screening test. The screening test done to pickup prostate cancer is,"['DRE', 'PSA', 'DRE + PSA', 'Endorectal coil MRI with T1 and T2 W images']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the options provided:

A. DRE (Digital Rectal Examination): This is a manual examination of the prostate gland performed by a healthcare provider to detect abnormalities, such as hard nodules or irregularities in the shape of the gland. While DRE can provide some information, its sensitivity and specificity for detecting prostate cancer are limited.

B. PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen): This is a blood test that measures the level of PSA, a substance produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels of PSA can indicate prostate cancer, but PSA levels can also be elevated due to benign conditions such as prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Therefore, while PSA is a useful screening tool, it is not perfect.

C. DRE + PSA: This option combines the manual examination of the prostate gland with a blood test to measure PSA levels. The combination of these two tests can improve the detection of prostate cancer, as they complement each other. DRE can identify palpable abnormalities, and PSA can detect non-palpable cancers.

D. Endorectal coil MRI with T1 and T2 W images: While MRI is a highly sensitive imaging modality for detecting prostate cancer, it is typically not used as a first-line screening test due to its cost and the need for specialized equipment and expertise.

Considering the options, the best choice for a screening test to detect prostate cancer in a 50-year-old male with a positive family history would be the combination of DRE and PSA, as it offers a good balance of sensitivity, specificity, and practicality.

Pulsus paradoxus- present.
Cardiac output- Increased.
The patient is in which type of shock?","['Neurogenic', 'Obstructive', 'Distributive', 'Hypovolemic']","To determine the type of shock the patient is experiencing, let's analyze the symptoms and signs presented:

1. **Excessive bleeding and drowsiness**: These symptoms are suggestive of a significant blood loss or a condition affecting the central nervous system. However, the question hints at a trauma-related scenario, so we'll focus on the bleeding aspect.

2. **Lacerated wound on lower back region**: This indicates a potential source of significant blood loss.

3. **Blood pressure-80/60mmHg**: This is indicative of hypotension, which can be due to various reasons including blood loss, fluid loss, or cardiac issues.

4. **Jugular venous pressure-low**: This could indicate decreased venous return or cardiac output, but in the context of the other signs, it's more likely related to hypovolemia.

5. **Pulsus paradoxus-present**: This is a sign of increased variability in the pulse with breathing, often seen in obstructive or restrictive lung conditions, but can also be seen in distributive shock due to autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

6. **Cardiac output-Increased**: This seems counterintuitive given the patient's hypotension, but it can occur in early stages of distributive shock as the body tries to compensate for the decreased blood volume.

Given these signs, the patient's condition is most likely due to excessive blood loss leading to a distributive shock. Distributive shock occurs when there's an abnormal distribution of blood volume within the body, often due to vasodilation. The key signs here point towards hypovolemia (due to blood loss) causing distributive shock, rather than the other options:

- **Neurogenic (A)**: This type of shock is associated with spinal cord injury leading to loss of sympathetic tone, causing vasodilation and decreased vascular resistance. While the patient's symptoms could somewhat align with neurogenic shock, the history of a lacerated wound and the focus on bleeding make this less likely.

- **Obstructive (B)**: This type of shock is due to a blockage in the heart or great vessels, which doesn't fit the patient's scenario of bleeding and the signs presented.

- **Distributive (C)**: This type of shock fits the patient's condition best, given the history of significant blood loss leading to hypovolemia and the signs of distributive shock.

- **Hypovolemic (D)**: While hypovolemic shock is a type of distributive shock caused by significant blood or fluid loss, the options provided allow for the choice of distributive shock as a broader category that encompasses hypovolemic shock.

724,CO2 is primarily transpoed in the aerial blood as,"['Dissolved CO2.', 'Carbonic Acid.', 'Carbamino-hemoglobin.', 'Bicarbonate']","To answer this question, let's consider how carbon dioxide (CO2) is transported in the blood.

CO2 is a byproduct of cellular metabolism and needs to be transported from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. There are several ways CO2 is transported in the blood, but the primary method is not by being dissolved in the plasma (A) or bound to hemoglobin as carbamino-hemoglobin (C). 

Carbonic acid (B) is indeed a form of CO2 in the blood, but it is not the primary form in which CO2 is transported in the arterial blood. Carbonic acid is formed when CO2 reacts with water in the blood, but it is quickly converted into bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+). This process occurs in the red blood cells and is facilitated by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.

Bicarbonate ions (D) are the primary form in which CO2 is transported in the blood, particularly in the arterial blood. This is because the reaction of CO2 with water to form carbonic acid and its subsequent conversion to bicarbonate ions is a buffering system that helps maintain acid-base balance in the body. The bicarbonate ion is then transported in the plasma from the tissues to the lungs, where it can be converted back into CO2 and exhaled.

1. **Age of onset**: The condition presents in a 1-year-old boy, indicating it is a genetic disorder that manifests early in life.
2. **Symptoms**: The child experiences a delay in motor development, followed by progressive muscle weakness, and eventually blindness, leading to death within a year. These symptoms suggest a neurodegenerative disorder.
3. **Autopsy findings**: The brain shows swollen neurons with numerous lysosomes filled with lipid. This is a critical clue because it points towards a disorder of lipid metabolism.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A. AL amyloidosis**: This condition involves the deposition of amyloid proteins in various tissues, including the kidneys, heart, and nerves. However, it doesn't specifically relate to lipid-filled lysosomes in neurons.

- **B. Hurler syndrome**: Also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I, this is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase. It leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in cells, but it doesn't specifically involve lipid-filled lysosomes.

- **C. Phenylketonuria (PKU)**: PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and brain. This can cause intellectual disability if not treated early. However, it doesn't cause the specific autopsy findings described.

- **D. Tay-Sachs disease**: This is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside within neurons. GM2 ganglioside is a type of lipid.

B. Portal Tracts: These are areas within the liver where blood vessels, bile ducts, and nerves enter and leave the liver. While they play a crucial role in the liver's structure and function, they are not considered the functional unit.

C. Liver Acinus: The liver acinus is a small region of the liver, consisting of a group of hepatocytes that are functionally connected and work together to perform liver functions. It is considered the functional unit of the liver because it represents the smallest region of the liver where a complete metabolic unit can be found.

734,Hyperchloremic acidosis is seen in-,"['A', 'Diarrhoea', 'DKA', 'Dehydration']","To answer this question, we need to understand what hyperchloremic acidosis is and the options provided.

Hyperchloremic acidosis is a type of metabolic acidosis characterized by an increase in chloride levels and a decrease in bicarbonate levels in the blood. This condition often occurs when there's a loss of bicarbonate or an addition of chloride ions to the body, such as through the use of certain medications, excessive use of diuretics, or in cases of gastrointestinal disorders that lead to the loss of bicarbonate.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

These devices deliver oxygen through a small catheter inserted into the nostrils. The flow rate is typically limited to 2-6 liters per minute (L/min), but the actual FiO2 delivered is not directly proportional to the flow rate due to the way oxygen is mixed with room air as it passes through the nasal passages.

Given the options and the limitations of nasal oxygen delivery, option B (0.6) seems too high for a nasal catheter. Typically, a maximum FiO2 of up to 0.44 (44%) is considered achievable with nasal oxygen therapy, as it's a function of the oxygen flow rate and the dilution by room air as the gas passes through the nasal passages.

741,"Daily water requirement in child weighing 30 kgs, height 123 m and BSA of 1 m2 is-","['1300 m1', '1700 ml', '2000 ml', '2500 ml']","To determine the daily water requirement for a child, we can use the general rule of 100 mL/kg body weight per day. However, since the child's height and body surface area (BSA) are given, we can also consider these factors as the child's body surface area is provided. The general estimate for water requirement is 1500-1800 mL/m²/day for children. 

Since the child's weight is 30 kg and BSA is 1 m², we can directly apply the rule for the BSA: 1500-1800 mL/m²/day * 1 m² = 1500-1800 mL. 

However, for more accurate calculation, we should consider the child's weight as well. The 100 mL/kg/day estimate can be used to calculate the total water requirement based on the child's weight: 100 mL/kg/day * 30 kg = 3000 mL. This is the total water requirement for the child, not the daily requirement. Since the child's BSA is 1 m², we can use the BSA-based estimate. 

The BSA-based estimate (1500-1800 mL/m²/day) seems to be a more accurate approach here given the child's BSA, but let's calculate the daily requirement using the 100 mL/kg/day estimate and adjust based on BSA as the BSA estimate might not fully capture the child's needs based solely on weight. 

So, let's calculate the water requirement: 1500-1800 mL/m²/day * 1 m² = 1500-1800 mL. This range is lower than the calculated total water requirement based on weight. The child's BSA is 1 m², and we can adjust the estimate based on the child's weight and BSA. The total water requirement is 3000 mL, but this is based solely on the child's weight and doesn't account for the child's BSA.

Considering the child's BSA and weight, and the estimates provided, the most accurate option is B. 1700 ml, as it falls within the estimated range for the child's BSA (1 m²) and accounts for the child's weight, albeit indirectly.

Phenytoin is a medication that follows zero-order kinetics, meaning that its rate of elimination is independent of its plasma concentration. This is because the enzyme responsible for its metabolism, CYP2C9, becomes saturated at low doses, leading to a non-linear dose-response relationship. This property makes it difficult to predict the plasma concentration of phenytoin and requires careful monitoring to avoid toxicity.

It affects the production of collagen, a protein that gives structure to bones, skin, and other tissues.

Option A: Incorrect. OI is an autosomal dominant condition, not a sex-linked disorder. It can affect both males and females equally, and is caused by mutations in genes that code for collagen.

Option B: Incorrect. While blue sclerae are a common feature of OI, they are not pathognomonic (a sign that is so characteristic of a disease that it can be used for diagnosis). Some individuals with OI may not have blue sclerae.

Option C: Correct. Hearing loss is a common feature of OI, and can range from mild to severe. It is thought to be due to the abnormal collagen in the middle ear.

Aortic regurgitation is characterized by the leakage of the aortic valve, allowing blood to flow back from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. The hallmark murmur associated with AR is a high-pitched decrescendo diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. This is option A, which is a characteristic murmur of aortic regurgitation, so we can eliminate this option as the correct answer.

Option B describes a soft, low-pitched mid-diastolic rumbling murmur, which is often associated with mitral stenosis rather than aortic regurgitation. This type of murmur is not typically associated with AR, making it a strong candidate for the correct answer.

Option C mentions a mid-systolic ejection flow murmur, which can be heard in patients with aortic regurgitation. This type of murmur is due to increased flow across the aortic valve during systole and is a common finding in AR. So, we can eliminate this option as well.

Option D describes a pansystolic murmur, which is not typically a characteristic murmur of aortic regurgitation.

In an acute aortic dissection, a tear in the inner layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, causing the aorta to dissect or split. This can lead to various symptoms and complications.

Manifestations of acute aortic dissection can include:

- **Pericardial effusion**: This can occur if the dissection extends to the pericardium, causing fluid to accumulate in the pericardial space. So, option A is a possible manifestation.
  
- **Aortic Regurgitation (AR)**: If the dissection affects the aortic valve, it can lead to regurgitation (leaking) of blood back into the left ventricle. Thus, option B is a correct association.

- **Mitral Regurgitation (MR)**: While less common, it's not entirely impossible for MR to occur secondary to acute aortic dissection, especially if the dissection affects the mitral valve indirectly or causes a complication that affects the mitral valve. However, this is less direct than AR. Option C is a less likely but possible manifestation.

- **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**: This is the most unlikely of the options directly related to the dissection process itself. While AMI can occur due to various reasons (e.g., coronary artery disease), it's not a direct manifestation of the dissection process.

Considering the options, the least likely manifestation directly caused by an acute aortic dissection would be AMI, making option D the correct answer.

753,Agonistic action at which of the following adrenergic receptor result in the reduction of excess secretion,"['Beta 1 receptor', 'Beta 2 receptor', 'M2 receptor', 'Alpha 2 receptor']","To answer this question, let's break down the role of each receptor mentioned in relation to secretion and adrenergic agonism.

A. Beta 1 receptors are primarily found in the heart, where their stimulation increases heart rate and contractility. They are not directly associated with the reduction of excess secretion.

B. Beta 2 receptors are found in smooth muscle, particularly in the bronchi and blood vessels. Stimulation of beta 2 receptors relaxes these muscles, causing bronchodilation and vasodilation. While they play a role in secretion in certain contexts, they are not primarily associated with reducing excess secretion.

C. M2 receptors are muscarinic receptors that are involved in the parasympathetic nervous system's action on the heart, primarily causing a decrease in heart rate. They are not directly related to adrenergic agonism or the reduction of excess secretion in the context provided.

D. Alpha 2 receptors have an inhibitory action on the release of various neurotransmitters and hormones, including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and others. Agonistic action at these receptors can lead to a reduction in the release of these substances, thereby reducing excess secretion.

Given the options and the context of the question, the correct answer is the one that involves the reduction of excess secretion through agonistic action on an adrenergic receptor.

A. Fasting serum gastrin: While elevated gastrin levels can be indicative of ZES, they are not specific to this condition. Other conditions, such as atrophic gastritis, can also lead to elevated gastrin levels.

B. Computed tomography (CT) scan: A CT scan can help identify tumors in the pancreas or duodenum, which are common sites for gastrinomas, the tumors that cause ZES. However, it may not directly diagnose the syndrome.

C. Endoscopy: Endoscopy, particularly with a thorough examination of the stomach and duodenum, can identify ulcers associated with ZES. However, it does not directly diagnose the underlying cause.

D. Secretin stimulation test: The secretin stimulation test is considered the most accurate diagnostic test for ZES. It involves administering secretin, a hormone that stimulates gastrin release, and measuring the gastrin response. In individuals with ZES, the gastrin level increases significantly after secretin administration. This test is more specific than fasting serum gastrin levels because it assesses the functional status of the gastrin-producing tumor.

A. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) can cause rib notching due to the presence of neurofibromas or osseous dysplasia, but it typically causes inferior rib notching. Therefore, while NF-1 can cause rib notching, it is not typically associated with both superior and inferior notching.

B. Blalock Taussig shunt, a surgical procedure to increase blood flow to the lungs, can cause rib notching due to the increased blood flow and subsequent erosion of the lower border of the ribs. However, this is typically seen in the context of increased blood flow to the lower parts of the lung, and thus would more likely be associated with inferior rib notching.

C. Superior vena cava (SVC) occlusion can cause dilatation of the upper intercostal veins as they drain into the azygos system to bypass the obstruction. This can lead to superior rib notching. However, SVC occlusion is not typically associated with inferior rib notching.

D. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital condition characterized by narrowing of the aorta, which can cause increased blood pressure in the upper body and decreased blood pressure in the lower body. This can lead to the development of collateral blood vessels, including the intercostal arteries, which can erode the lower border of the ribs, causing inferior rib notching. Additionally, the increased blood flow through the upper intercostal veins can lead to superior rib notching.

A. Presence of interstitial inflammation: Viral pneumonia often presents with interstitial inflammation, which is characterized by inflammation of the tissue and spaces around the air sacs of the lungs. This is a common feature of viral pneumonia, so option A is not the correct answer.

B. Predominance of alveolar exudate: Alveolar exudate refers to the accumulation of fluid, cells, and other substances in the alveoli, which are the air sacs of the lungs. While viral pneumonia can cause some alveolar exudate, it is more commonly associated with interstitial inflammation rather than a predominance of alveolar exudate. This makes option B a strong candidate for the correct answer.

C. Bronchiolitis: Bronchiolitis is an inflammation of the bronchioles, which are the small airways in the lungs. Viral infections can cause bronchiolitis, especially in children, so option C is a feature that can be seen in viral pneumonia.

D. Multinucleate giant cells in the bronchiolar wall: Multinucleate giant cells are a type of cell that can be seen in viral infections, including viral pneumonia. These cells are formed when multiple nuclei fuse together, and they are often seen in the bronchiolar walls in cases of viral pneumonia.

Based on the information above, the correct answer is B. Predominance of alveolar exudate, as viral pneumonia is more commonly associated with interstitial inflammation rather than a predominance of alveolar exudate.

763,False about stagardt's disease,"['Autosomal dominant', 'No family history', 'Beaten bronze appearance fundus', 'ERG and EOG both are normal']","To solve this question, let's evaluate each option in relation to Stargardt's disease:

A. Autosomal dominant - Stargardt's disease is actually an autosomal recessive disorder, not autosomal dominant. This option could potentially be the answer.

B. No family history - Since Stargardt's disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, it can indeed present with no family history if both parents are carriers and the affected individual inherits the two defective alleles from them. Thus, this statement might be true for some cases and does not clearly indicate the disease itself, making it less likely to be the false statement.

C. Beaten bronze appearance fundus - The fundus in Stargardt's disease often shows a ""beaten bronze"" or ""frosted window"" appearance due to the accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium. This is a characteristic feature of the disease, so it is true.

D. ERG and EOG both are normal - Early in the disease, the electrooculogram (EOG) can be affected before the electroretinogram (ERG), showing a reduced Arden ratio. However, both tests may eventually become abnormal as the disease progresses. Therefore, stating that both are normal is false, especially considering the EOG might be affected early.

Local anesthetics work by blocking the sensation of pain in a specific area. They do this by affecting the nervous system.

A. Block the release of neurotransmitters - This option is incorrect because local anesthetics do not primarily work by blocking the release of neurotransmitters. They are more directly involved with the electrical activity of neurons.

B. Block the influx of sodium into the cell - This is the correct answer. Local anesthetics work by blocking the sodium channels on the neuron's membrane. This prevents the depolarization of the neuron, which is necessary for the transmission of pain signals. By blocking sodium channels, local anesthetics prevent the signal from being transmitted to the brain.

C. Increase the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters - This option is incorrect because local anesthetics do not primarily work by increasing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. They work more directly on the electrical activity of neurons.

D. Inhibit the efflux of sodium from neurons - This option is incorrect because the primary mechanism of action of local anesthetics is to block the influx of sodium into the cell, not to inhibit the efflux of sodium.

C. Succinyl choline: This is a muscle relaxant used for intubation. It can cause a transient increase in heart rate (tachycardia) followed by a decrease in heart rate (bradycardia), but the bradycardia is not the primary effect.

D. Dopamine: This is a medication used to increase blood pressure. It can increase heart rate (tachycardia) in low doses and decrease heart rate (bradycardia) in high doses, but the primary effect at low doses is tachycardia.

Considering these effects, the medication most directly associated with causing bradycardia is midazolam.

785,The earliest manifestation of increased intracranial pressure following head injury is:,"['Ipsilateral pupillary dilatation', 'Contralateral pupillary dilatation', 'Altered mental status', 'Hemiparesis']","To approach this question, let's consider the signs and symptoms associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) following a head injury.

1. **Altered mental status (C)**: This is a non-specific symptom that can be seen in various conditions, including head injuries. However, it's not the most specific early sign of increased ICP.

2. **Hemiparesis (D)**: This refers to weakness on one side of the body, which can occur due to a variety of reasons, including cerebral edema or a mass lesion. While it can be a result of increased ICP, it's not the earliest manifestation.

3. **Contralateral pupillary dilatation (B)**: This is a specific sign that can be associated with increased ICP, particularly when it's due to a space-occupying lesion (like a hematoma) pushing the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) against the opposite (contralateral) side of the brain. However, ipsilateral pupillary dilatation is more directly associated with herniation, which is a critical sign of increased ICP.

4. **Ipsilateral pupillary dilatation (A)**: This is a very specific and critical sign of impending herniation due to increased ICP. When the brain shifts due to increased pressure, it can compress the third cranial nerve on the same side as the injury, leading to pupillary dilatation. This is often an early sign that something critical is happening and can indicate a need for immediate intervention, such as decompressive surgery.

Given these considerations, the correct answer is **A. Ipsilateral pupillary dilatation**, as it is the earliest manifestation of increased ICP following a head injury due to its direct association with herniation, which is a critical and life-threatening condition.

786,Failure of migration of neural crest cells is seen in:,"['Albinism', 'Congenital megacolon', 'Odontomes', 'Adrenal tumour']","To answer this question, we need to consider the role of neural crest cells in embryonic development.

Neural crest cells are a transient, multipotent cell population that originates from the dorsal neural tube during vertebrate embryogenesis. They migrate extensively throughout the body and differentiate into a wide range of cell types, including:

* Pigment cells (melanocytes) in the skin and eyes
* Adrenal medullary cells
* Cells of the autonomic nervous system
* Odontoblasts (dental pulp cells)
* Cells of the enteric nervous system, which innervates the gastrointestinal tract

Given these functions, we can evaluate the options:

A. Albinism - While albinism is related to the pigmentation of the skin and eyes, it is not directly related to the failure of neural crest cell migration.

B. Congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease) - This condition involves the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, which are derived from neural crest cells that failed to migrate during embryonic development. This option directly relates to neural crest cell migration.

C. Odontomes - These are tumors of the jaw that can arise from odontogenic epithelium, but they are not directly related to neural crest cell migration.

D. Adrenal tumour - While the adrenal glands do contain cells derived from neural crest cells, this option does not directly relate to the failure of neural crest cell migration.

Plague is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas or direct contact with infected animals. In a plague ward, healthcare workers are at risk of exposure to the bacterium.

Prophylaxis measures are essential to prevent infection. Let's evaluate the options:

a) Vaccine: The plague vaccine is used to prevent plague infection in people who are at high risk, such as healthcare workers working in plague wards. So, this option is correct.

b) Tetracycline throughout the duty: Tetracycline is an antibiotic that can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent plague infection if exposure has occurred. This option is also correct.

c) A course of tetracycline: This option is similar to option b, but it specifies a course of treatment, which is also a valid approach for PEP.

d) Vaccine and Erythromycin: Erythromycin is an antibiotic that can be used as PEP, but it is not typically used as the primary choice for plague prophylaxis. 

e) Observation: Observation alone is not sufficient for prophylaxis, as it does not provide protection against infection.

Considering the options, the most comprehensive and correct answer would include both the vaccine (for prevention) and tetracycline or a course of tetracycline (for post-exposure prophylaxis).

This surgical procedure is used to prevent preterm birth in women with cervical insufficiency.

A. Leaking membranes - This is indeed a contraindication for a cerclage. If the membranes have already ruptured, a cerclage is not indicated because the risk of infection and preterm birth is already high.

B. Features of amnionitis - This refers to a condition where there is an infection of the amniotic fluid. This is a contraindication because the infection can spread to the mother and is a life-threatening condition.

C. History of vaginal bleeding - While vaginal bleeding can be a complication of pregnancy, it is not typically listed as a direct contraindication for a cerclage procedure. The main concern with cerclage is maintaining the integrity of the cervix to prevent preterm birth, not directly addressing vaginal bleeding.

D. Pregnancy beyond 14 weeks - This is generally considered a contraindication for a cerclage because the risk of preterm labor and birth increases significantly after 14 weeks of gestation. Performing a cerclage after this point is less likely to prevent preterm birth.

Epithelial chloride channel protein, also known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), is crucial for regulating the movement of chloride ions across epithelial cell membranes. This movement is essential for producing mucus, sweat, and digestive fluids. 

Let's evaluate each option:

A. Ehlers Danlos syndrome is a group of genetic disorders affecting the body's connective tissue, which provides support to various structures, including skin, bones, blood vessels, and many others. It's primarily linked to mutations in genes coding for collagen proteins, not epithelial chloride channel proteins.

B. Marfan syndrome is another genetic disorder affecting the body's connective tissue. It's primarily associated with mutations in the FBN1 gene, which codes for fibrillin-1, a protein crucial for the formation of elastic fibers in connective tissue.

C. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to abnormal function of the epithelial chloride channel protein. This results in the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and traps bacteria, leading to recurrent respiratory infections and other complications.

D. Diabetes insipidus is a condition characterized by the inability of the body to regulate fluids, leading to excessive thirst and urination. It's typically associated with issues in the hypothalamus or the kidneys, not directly with the abnormal function of epithelial chloride channel proteins.

Which amongst the following is the least likely diagnosis -,"['Hemolytic jaundice', 'Crigler Najjar syndrome', ""Gilbert's syndrome"", 'Dubin Johnson syndrome']","To answer this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario:

1. **Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia**: This means that the bilirubin in the blood has not yet been conjugated (processed) by the liver. This is a key point for understanding the cause of jaundice.
   
2. **Presence of urobilinogen in urine**: Urobilinogen is a product of bilirubin breakdown. Its presence in urine indicates that bilirubin is being broken down, suggesting that the liver is still able to process bilirubin to some extent.

Now, let's consider the options:

- **A. Hemolytic jaundice**: This condition involves the breakdown of red blood cells faster than they can be made, leading to increased bilirubin production. Since the bilirubin is being produced (as opposed to being reabsorbed from the intestines, which is more common in conditions like Dubin Johnson syndrome), this is a likely diagnosis with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and urobilinogen in urine.

- **B. Crigler Najjar syndrome**: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the enzyme responsible for converting unconjugated bilirubin to conjugated bilirubin. It leads to severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is consistent with the given clinical presentation.

- **C. Gilbert's syndrome**: This is another condition that affects the liver's ability to process bilirubin, leading to mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It's often triggered by stress, fasting, or illness and is consistent with the given scenario.

- **D. Dubin Johnson syndrome**: This is a rare genetic disorder that causes chronic jaundice due to an inability to secrete conjugated bilirubin into the bile. This leads to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, not unconjugated bilirubin. It would be an unlikely diagnosis in someone with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Given the information, **D. Dubin Johnson syndrome** is the least likely diagnosis because it typically causes conjugated, not unconjugated, hyperbilirubinemia.

806,Dobutamine differs from dopamine in that,"['It has good blood-brain barrier penetrability', 'It causes pronounced tachycardia', 'It does not activate adrenergic b receptors', 'It does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors']","To answer this question, let's analyze the properties of dobutamine and dopamine:

1. **Blood-Brain Barrier Penetrability**: Dobutamine has poor blood-brain barrier penetrability, whereas dopamine can cross the blood-brain barrier. This characteristic makes dopamine more likely to cause central nervous system effects. Therefore, option A is incorrect because dobutamine actually has poor blood-brain barrier penetrability.

2. **Tachycardia**: Both dobutamine and dopamine can increase heart rate (tachycardia) due to their beta-adrenergic effects. However, the degree of tachycardia can vary between the two drugs. Dobutamine tends to be more selective for beta-1 receptors, which are primarily responsible for increasing heart rate, whereas dopamine also has significant beta-2 effects that contribute to vasodilation. Nonetheless, both drugs can cause tachycardia, making option B less likely to be the correct answer.

3. **Activation of Adrenergic β receptors**: Dobutamine is known for its selective activation of beta-1 adrenergic receptors, which increases contractility of the heart and heart rate. Dopamine, on the other hand, has a broader range of effects that include alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 receptors, depending on the dose. At lower doses, dopamine acts more like norepinephrine and increases peripheral vascular resistance. Therefore, option C is incorrect because dobutamine does activate adrenergic β receptors, particularly beta-1 receptors.

4. **Activation of Peripheral Dopaminergic Receptors**: Dobutamine primarily acts on beta-1 adrenergic receptors and does not significantly activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors. Dopamine, however, activates dopamine receptors at lower doses, leading to vasodilation in renal and mesenteric vessels, among others. This difference in receptor activity is a key point of distinction between the two drugs. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

NOT RELATED -anatomy","['Common iliac nodes', 'Parametrial nodes', 'External iliac node', 'Paracervical or ureteral nodes']","The correct answer is D. Paracervical or ureteral nodes.

In cervical cancer, the lymphatic spread typically follows a predictable pattern. Initially, the cancer metastasizes to the parametrial nodes, which are located alongside the cervix. However, the first group of lymph nodes involved in metastatic spread beyond the cervix and uterus would actually be the paracervical or ureteral nodes. These nodes are located in the parametrium, close to the cervix and are the first echelon of lymph nodes in the drainage of the cervix.

The common iliac nodes (A) would be involved later in the metastatic spread, after the cancer has spread to more proximal nodes.

B. Serum ceruloplasmin level < 20 mg/dL - Wilson's disease is characterized by low levels of serum ceruloplasmin, a protein that binds copper in the blood. Typically, serum ceruloplasmin levels are less than 20 mg/dL in patients with Wilson's disease, making this statement true.

D. Zinc acetate is used as maintenance therapy - Zinc acetate is used to treat Wilson's disease and can be part of the maintenance therapy. It helps to reduce copper absorption from the gut and increase its excretion. This statement is true.

C. Urinary copper excretion < 100 microgram/24 hours - In Wilson's disease, urinary copper excretion is typically increased, not decreased. A key diagnostic criterion is the presence of excessive urinary copper excretion, often exceeding 100 microgram/24 hours. This statement is false in the context of Wilson's disease.

812,The study for correlation of genetic disease to consanguinity -,"['Case Contral Study', 'Cohort study', 'Cross-sectional study', 'Case report']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider what each study type is best suited for:

A. Case Control Study: This study design is used to investigate the association between a particular disease (in this case, a genetic disease) and a potential risk factor (in this case, consanguinity, which is the practice of marrying within the family). It is particularly useful for studying rare diseases and for identifying potential risk factors.

B. Cohort Study: This study design involves following a group of individuals over time to see how their exposures affect their risk of developing a disease. It's more about identifying risk factors and outcomes over time rather than the association between two specific variables at a single point in time.

C. Cross-sectional Study: This study design involves looking at a population at a single point in time to identify the prevalence of a disease and potential risk factors. While it can provide insights into the associations between variables, it's not as effective as case-control studies for studying rare diseases or rare exposures.

D. Case Report: A case report is a detailed report of a single individual's experience with a medical condition. While it can provide rich information about a particular case, it's not a study design that allows for the generalization of findings to a larger population.

Given the context of the question, which is to study the correlation between genetic disease and consanguinity, the best study design to use would be a case-control study. This is because it allows researchers to compare individuals with the disease (cases) to those without the disease (controls) to see if there's an association between consanguinity and the development of genetic disease.

A. Depend on laminar flow for their accuracy: This statement is true. Rotameters rely on the principle of laminar flow to measure fluid flow rates accurately. Laminar flow occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no turbulence, allowing for precise measurement.

B. Will only function when upright: This statement is false. While it's true that rotameters are often mounted upright, their functionality isn't limited to being upright. They can be mounted horizontally or at an angle, as long as the fluid flows through the tapered tube in a laminar manner.

C. Are constant pressure drop-constant orifice devices: This statement is false. Rotameters measure fluid flow rates by detecting changes in pressure drop across the orifice. However, the pressure drop is not constant; it varies with flow rate. This variation is what allows the rotameter's float to move up or down the tapered tube, indicating the flow rate.

D. Are not accurate below 1L/min: This statement is false. Rotameters can be accurate at flow rates below 1L/min, depending on the specific device and its design. However, the accuracy may decrease at very low flow rates due to factors like friction and turbulence.

A. Due to ovarian enlargement and fragility - This option is true. OHSS is characterized by the enlargement of the ovaries, which become fragile and prone to rupture. This is a result of the overstimulation of the ovaries during fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).

B. Increase in intravascular volume - This statement is actually false in the context of OHSS pathogenesis. One of the hallmarks of OHSS is actually a decrease in intravascular volume, not an increase. This decrease leads to a hemoconcentration state, which is a critical aspect of the syndrome's pathophysiology. The decrease in intravascular volume is partly due to the third spacing of fluids, where fluid shifts from the vascular compartment to the third space, such as the abdominal cavity, leading to hemoconcentration and potentially severe complications.

C. Role of VEGF and inflammatory cytokines - This option is true. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory cytokines are both involved in the pathogenesis of OHSS. VEGF promotes angiogenesis and vascular permeability, contributing to the ovarian enlargement and fluid shift seen in OHSS. Inflammatory cytokines also play a role in the syndrome's development.

D. Secondary to infertility treatment - This option is true. OHSS is a complication of fertility treatments, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and gonadotropins used in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like IVF.

Given the analysis above, the correct answer is the option that does not accurately describe the pathogenesis of OHSS.

Which of the following is the likely pathogen?","['Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus pneumonia', 'Neisseria meningitides', 'Listeria monocytogenes']","To determine the likely pathogen, let's analyze the given information:

* High-grade fever, headache, neck stiffness, and positive Kernig's sign suggest meningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges.
* The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing neutrophilic predominance indicates a bacterial infection, as neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that is typically associated with acute bacterial infections.
* Low glucose levels in the CSF can be seen in bacterial meningitis due to the consumption of glucose by the bacteria.
* The Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay being positive is indicative of the presence of endotoxin, which is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

Given these clues, the likely pathogen is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes meningitis. Among the options provided:

- Staphylococcus aureus (A) is a Gram-positive bacterium and is less likely to cause meningitis compared to the other options.
- Streptococcus pneumoniae (B) is a Gram-positive bacterium and is a common cause of bacterial meningitis, but the presence of endotoxin (positive LAL assay) points towards a Gram-negative cause.
- Neisseria meningitidis (C) is a Gram-negative bacterium known to cause meningococcal meningitis, which is consistent with the clinical presentation and CSF analysis.

819,Decreased basal metabolic rate is seen in,"['Obesity', 'Hypehyroidism', 'Feeding', 'Exercise']","Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories the body needs to function at rest. A decreased BMR would indicate that the body's energy expenditure is lower than usual.

Obesity (A) is often associated with a decreased BMR. This is because excess body fat can lead to a decrease in the body's metabolic rate, making it harder to lose weight.

Hypothyroidism (B) is actually associated with a decreased BMR, not an increased one. However, this is not the correct answer choice.

Feeding (C) increases BMR, not decreases it. This is because the body needs to expend energy to digest and process the food.

Exercise (D) increases BMR, not decreases it. Regular physical activity can increase the body's metabolic rate, helping to burn calories and maintain weight.

822,Inheritance of ABO blood group is:,"['X-linked inheritance', 'Recessive inheritance', 'Mitochondria] inheritance', 'Codominance']","The correct answer is D. Codominance.

The ABO blood group system is determined by a single gene on chromosome 9, with three alleles (A, B, and O) that code for the production of different antigens on the surface of red blood cells. Each individual can be classified into one of four phenotypes: A, B, AB, or O. In codominance, both alleles have an equal effect on the phenotype, resulting in the expression of both A and B antigens in individuals with the AB phenotype. This is in contrast to recessive inheritance, where one allele is dominant over the other, and mitochondrial inheritance, which is specific to the transmission of traits from mother to offspring through the mitochondria. X-linked inheritance is also incorrect, as the ABO blood group gene is located on an autosome, not on the X chromosome.

823,All of the followings are responsible for Right shifting of O2 saturation curve; except:,"['Hypoxia', 'Hypocapnia', 'Increase temp', 'Increased 2,3 DPG']","To answer this question, we need to understand the factors that can cause a right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.

A right shift of the curve indicates that the hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen and is more willing to release oxygen to the tissues. This is often seen in conditions where there is an increased demand for oxygen or when the blood is more acidic (as in lactic acidosis).

Let's examine the options:

A. Hypoxia - This is a condition where there is a lack of oxygen. In response, the body shifts the curve to the right, increasing oxygen delivery to the tissues. So, this is a correct example of a right shift.

C. Increase temp - An increase in body temperature also causes a right shift of the curve, promoting more oxygen delivery to the tissues. This is a correct example of a right shift.

D. Increased 2,3 DPG - 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) is a molecule that decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, promoting a right shift of the curve. This is correct.

B. Hypocapnia - This is a condition of decreased carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Hypocapnia tends to cause a left shift of the curve, not a right shift. This is because the Bohr effect, which is the tendency of hemoglobin to release oxygen in response to increased CO2 levels, is reversed in hypocapnia, leading to a tighter binding of oxygen to hemoglobin.

The fatty acid synthase complex is a multi-enzyme complex responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The key enzymes involved in this complex are:

1. Ketoacyl synthase (KS) - catalyzes the condensation of acyl groups to form a beta-ketoacyl group.
2. Ketoacyl reductase (KR) - reduces the beta-keto group to a hydroxyl group.
3. Dehydratase (DH) - removes two water molecules to form a trans double bond.
4. Enoyl reductase (ER) - reduces the double bond to form a saturated acyl group.
5. Acyl carrier protein (ACP) - carries the acyl group during the elongation process.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. Ketoacyl reductase - This is part of the fatty acid synthase complex.

B. Enoyl reductase - This is also part of the fatty acid synthase complex.

C. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase - This enzyme is involved in the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis, converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. However, it is not part of the fatty acid synthase complex itself.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","['MEN type I', 'MEN type II', 'MEN type III', ""Sipple's syndrome""]","To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's break down the symptoms and conditions mentioned:

1. **Paroxysmal hypertension**: This condition is often associated with pheochromocytoma, which is a type of tumor that occurs in the adrenal glands and releases excess catecholamines, leading to sudden spikes in blood pressure.

2. **Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid**: This is a rare type of thyroid cancer that originates from the parafollicular cells (also known as C cells) of the thyroid gland.

3. **Pheochromocytoma**: As mentioned, this is a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes catecholamines, leading to hypertension.

4. **Mucosal neuromas**: These are benign growths on the mucous membranes that can occur in various parts of the body, including the lips, tongue, and other areas.

5. **Parathyroid involvement is not noted**: This is an important distinction since involvement of the parathyroid glands is a key feature in some of the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.

Given these symptoms, let's evaluate the options:

- **MEN type I (A)** involves hyperparathyroidism (not noted in this case), pituitary adenomas, and pancreatic islet cell tumors. This does not match the described symptoms.

- **MEN type II (B)** is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. Although this option includes the key features of the case, the absence of hyperparathyroidism makes it a less likely choice.

- **MEN type III (C)**, also known as MEN 2B, includes medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. This option aligns with the patient's symptoms.

- **Sipple's syndrome (D)** is another term for MEN type II A, which includes medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma but typically does not involve mucosal neuromas.

Based on the combination of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas without parathyroid involvement, the most likely diagnosis is MEN type III.

A. Cirrhosis: In cirrhosis, the liver is unable to effectively regulate glucose metabolism, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. This is due to impaired insulin signaling and reduced insulin production. So, hyperglycemia can be seen in cirrhosis.

B. Myotonic dystrophy: This is a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and can lead to various systemic complications. Importantly, myotonic dystrophy is associated with insulin resistance, which can cause hyperglycemia. Therefore, hyperglycemia is indeed seen in myotonic dystrophy.

C. Lipodystrophy: Lipodystrophy is a condition characterized by the loss or redistribution of body fat. It can be associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia due to the loss of adipose tissue, which plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

D. Sarcoma: Sarcoma is a type of cancer that arises from connective tissue, such as bone, cartilage, or fat. While cancer can cause a variety of metabolic disturbances, there is no direct association between sarcoma and hyperglycemia as a primary or common feature of the disease.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is the condition that is least likely to be associated with hyperglycemia as a primary feature.

839,Which of the following statements about cutaneous shunt~vessels is true?,"['Perform nutritive function', 'Have role in thermoregulation', 'Not under the control of autonomic nervous system', 'These vessels are evenly distributed throughout the skin']","To answer this question, let's consider each option in relation to what cutaneous shunt vessels are and how they function.

A. Perform nutritive function - This statement is not true. Cutaneous shunt vessels are primarily involved in regulating blood flow and temperature, not performing nutritive functions. Nutritive functions are generally associated with capillary beds, not shunt vessels.

B. Have role in thermoregulation - This statement is true. Cutaneous shunt vessels play a significant role in thermoregulation. They can open to allow more blood to flow near the surface of the skin, releasing heat, and can close to reduce blood flow, conserving heat. This process helps the body to maintain its temperature in response to changes in the environment.

C. Not under the control of autonomic nervous system - This statement is not true. Cutaneous shunt vessels are under the control of the autonomic nervous system, which allows for involuntary regulation of blood flow based on the body's needs and environmental conditions.

D. These vessels are evenly distributed throughout the skin - This statement is not true. Shunt vessels are not evenly distributed throughout the skin. They are more common in certain areas, such as the fingers and toes, where they can be more active in thermoregulation.

843,Drug used in cancer chemotherapy induced vomiting is?,"['Aprepitant', 'Dexamethasone', 'Ondansetrin', 'All of the above']","To address this question, let's examine each option in relation to cancer chemotherapy-induced vomiting.

A. Aprepitant: Aprepitant is a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. It is indeed used in conjunction with other antiemetics to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Its role is particularly crucial in preventing delayed emesis, which can occur 24 to 120 hours after chemotherapy.

B. Dexamethasone: Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties. In the context of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, dexamethasone is used as an antiemetic. It is particularly effective for preventing delayed emesis.

C. Ondansetron: Ondansetron is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which is also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy. It's effective in preventing acute emesis but is less effective for delayed emesis.

Given that all of these options (Aprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron) are used in the management of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, the correct answer includes all of them.

847,Patient came to the OPD with recent onset photphobia within 24 hours and sloughing corneal ulcer. There is greenish ulcer base. Which of the following can be the causative organism:,"['Acanthamoeba', 'Nocardia', 'Pseudomonas', 'Herpes']","Based on the symptoms described, I would choose option C. Pseudomonas.

The presence of a greenish ulcer base and a recent onset of photophobia within 24 hours suggests a bacterial corneal ulcer, specifically one caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas is a common cause of bacterial keratitis, and it often presents with a characteristic ""greenish"" or ""feathery"" ulcer base. The rapid onset of symptoms, including photophobia, is also consistent with Pseudomonas keratitis.

The other options are not as likely to cause the symptoms described:

A. Acanthamoeba: This organism is a common cause of contact lens-associated keratitis, but it typically presents with a more insidious onset of symptoms and a characteristic ""ring"" or ""feathery"" infiltrate in the cornea.

B. Nocardia: This organism is a type of aerobic actinomycete that can cause corneal ulcers, but it typically presents with a more chronic course and a characteristic ""sulfur granule"" or ""beaded"" appearance on Gram stain.

D. Herpes: This virus can cause herpetic keratitis, which typically presents with a dendritic ulcer and a history of recurrent episodes, rather than a sudden onset of photophobia and a greenish ulcer base.

848,The advantage of using a tooth positioner as a retainer is :,"['Final setting of occlusion', 'Used in uncooperative patients', 'Esthetics', 'Gingival margin inflamed during orthodontic treatment']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the advantages of using a tooth positioner as a retainer.

A tooth positioner is a type of retainer that is designed to hold teeth in their new position after orthodontic treatment. It is typically a clear, plastic appliance that covers the teeth and is worn for a specific period of time.

Option A, ""Final setting of occlusion"", is incorrect because while a tooth positioner can help to stabilize the teeth and prevent relapse, it is not primarily used to set the occlusion.

Option B, ""Used in uncooperative patients"", is incorrect because a tooth positioner is not typically used as a treatment for uncooperative patients. Instead, it is used as a retainer to maintain the results of orthodontic treatment.

Option C, ""Esthetics"", is correct because a tooth positioner can be a discreet and esthetically pleasing way to maintain the position of the teeth after orthodontic treatment. It is often preferred by patients who want to maintain a natural appearance without wearing traditional metal retainers.

Option D, ""Gingival margin inflamed during orthodontic treatment"", is incorrect because a tooth positioner is not used specifically to address inflamed gingival margins during orthodontic treatment.

849,NOT a cause of granular contracted kidney ?,"['Diabetes mellitus', 'Chronic pyelonephritis', 'Benign nephrosclerosis', 'Chronic glomerulonephritis']","To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to its potential to cause granular contracted kidney.

Granular contracted kidney is a characteristic histological appearance of a kidney that has undergone chronic damage and scarring. This condition is often seen in diseases that cause chronic inflammation or damage to the kidneys.

A. Diabetes mellitus: Diabetes can cause diabetic nephropathy, which can lead to a granular contracted kidney due to chronic damage and scarring from high blood sugar levels.

B. Chronic pyelonephritis: This is a condition characterized by recurring or persistent infections of the kidneys. Chronic pyelonephritis can cause scarring and contraction of the kidney, leading to a granular contracted kidney.

C. Benign nephrosclerosis: This condition is caused by chronic high blood pressure, which can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to scarring and contraction of the kidney. However, it typically results in a more uniform contraction and is less likely to result in a granular appearance.

D. Chronic glomerulonephritis: This condition is characterized by chronic inflammation of the glomeruli, which can lead to scarring and contraction of the kidney. It is a classic cause of a granular contracted kidney.

Considering these options, benign nephrosclerosis (C) is the least likely to result in a granular contracted kidney, as it typically causes a more uniform contraction and does not have the same level of glomerular or tubular damage as the other conditions.

The DGC is a complex of proteins that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of muscle cells. The main components of the DGC include:

1. Dystrophin: A large cytoplasmic protein that anchors the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane.
2. Dystroglycan: A transmembrane protein consisting of two subunits (α and β) that interact with dystrophin on the cytoplasmic side and laminin on the extracellular side.
3. Sarcoglycans: A family of transmembrane proteins (α-sarcoglycan, β-sarcoglycan, γ-sarcoglycan, δ-sarcoglycan, and ε-sarcoglycan) that work together with dystroglycan and dystrophin to form the DGC.
4. Syntrophins and syntrophin-associated proteins: These include other proteins that interact with the DGC, but they are not as directly integral to its structure as the above-mentioned proteins.

Perlecan, however, is a large heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is a component of the basement membrane, not a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. It is involved in cell adhesion, cell signaling, and the regulation of growth factor activity.

Hypercalcemia can be caused by various factors, including malignancies. Among the cancers listed, one type is particularly well-known for its association with hypercalcemia due to the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which mimics the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and leads to increased calcium levels.

Let's evaluate the options:

A. Renal cell cancer - While renal cell cancer can cause hypercalcemia, it is not the most common association.

B. Carcinoma stomach - Stomach cancer is not typically associated with hypercalcemia.

C. Squamous cell carcinoma of lung - This type of lung cancer is well-known for its association with hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with a history of smoking. The cancer cells can produce PTHrP, leading to increased calcium levels.

D. Hepatocellular carcinoma - While hepatocellular carcinoma can cause various metabolic disturbances, it is not commonly associated with hypercalcemia.

A. Ultraviolet radiation: This is a well-established risk factor for SCC. Prolonged exposure to UV radiation, whether from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds, significantly increases the risk of developing SCC.

B. Tar: Exposure to tar, a component of coal and tobacco smoke, is also a known risk factor for SCC. Tar can cause skin damage and mutations that can lead to cancer development.

C. Tobacco: Tobacco use, particularly smoking, is a significant risk factor for SCC, as well as other cancers. Tobacco contains numerous carcinogens that can cause genetic mutations leading to cancer.

D. HPV 18: While certain types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in the context of cervical cancer (HPV 16 and 18 are most commonly implicated), the question's focus on squamous cell carcinoma of the skin makes this option less directly relevant. In the skin, HPV types 5 and 8 are more commonly associated with SCC, especially in individuals with a history of skin cancer or immunosuppression.

Given the context of the question and the options provided, the answer is focused on SCC of the skin, which makes HPV 18 (a type more commonly associated with cervical cancer) the least directly relevant or the correct exception.

858,PK reactio detects -,"['IgG', 'IgA', 'IgE', 'IgM']","To answer this question, let's break down what PK reaction refers to and the options given.

PK reaction is a method used to detect the presence of specific antibodies in a blood sample. It is a type of precipitation reaction that involves the interaction of antigens with their corresponding antibodies, leading to the formation of a visible precipitate.

The options given refer to different types of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the body:

- IgG: The most abundant antibody in the blood, providing long-term protection against infections.
- IgA: Found mainly in mucosal areas (like the gut and respiratory tract), helping to protect these surfaces against infections.
- IgE: Primarily associated with allergic reactions and parasite infections, it is the least abundant of the five classes of immunoglobulins.
- IgM: The first antibody produced in response to an infection, it's particularly effective at activating the complement system, which helps destroy pathogens.

Given this information, the PK reaction is most commonly associated with detecting IgM antibodies. This is because IgM antibodies are the first to be produced in response to an infection and are very effective at activating the complement system. The PK reaction is a good method for detecting these early responses because it's sensitive to the presence of IgM antibodies.

860,Which is True about dobutamine?,"['Dobutamine decreases peripheral resistance', 'Acts on D1 and D2 receptors', 'Decrease kidney circulation', 'Has no effect on coronary circulation']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the properties of dobutamine:

1. **Mechanism of Action**: Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that primarily acts as a beta-1 agonist, with some beta-2 and alpha-1 activity. Its primary effects are on the heart, increasing contractility and heart rate.

2. **Effects on Peripheral Resistance**: Dobutamine, due to its beta-1 and alpha-1 receptor agonist properties, does increase heart rate and contractility, which can lead to an increase in cardiac output. However, its effect on peripheral resistance is more nuanced. Beta-2 receptors cause vasodilation, which would decrease peripheral resistance, while alpha-1 receptors cause vasoconstriction, which would increase peripheral resistance. The net effect can be complex and is often described as having minimal effect on systemic vascular resistance, but in a clinical context, it might not significantly decrease peripheral resistance compared to its other effects.

3. **Action on D1 and D2 Receptors**: Dobutamine primarily acts on adrenergic receptors (beta-1, beta-2, alpha-1), not dopamine receptors (D1 and D2). Its action is not described in terms of dopamine receptor agonism.

4. **Effect on Kidney Circulation**: Dobutamine can potentially reduce renal blood flow due to its vasoconstrictive effects on the renal arteries, similar to its effects on other vascular beds. However, this is more of a concern in certain clinical contexts, such as heart failure or when using high doses.

5. **Effect on Coronary Circulation**: Dobutamine increases heart rate and contractility, which can increase myocardial oxygen demand. It also causes coronary vasodilation, particularly at higher doses, which can increase blood flow to the heart. This makes it useful in stress testing for cardiac patients.

Given these points:

- A is somewhat correct, but the effect on peripheral resistance is more nuanced than a straightforward decrease.
- B is incorrect because dobutamine primarily acts on adrenergic receptors, not dopamine receptors.
- C is incorrect because while dobutamine might decrease renal blood flow, the statement is too absolute and does not reflect its complex effects.
- D is incorrect because dobutamine does have an effect on coronary circulation, particularly in increasing blood flow.

However, considering the nuances and the typical interpretation of these questions, A might be the most accurate description given in the options, despite being somewhat oversimplified.

It is appropriate in all except,"['Transformation zone lying entirely on ectocervix.', 'Smooth cervical surface without deep crevices.', 'Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia -3.', 'CIN limited to two quadrants of the cervix.']","To answer this question, let's consider the criteria for appropriate use of cryosurgery in treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN):

1. **Transformation zone lying entirely on ectocervix (Option A):** Cryosurgery is effective for treating CIN lesions that are located on the ectocervix. The transformation zone is often located on the ectocervix, so this option does not indicate an inappropriate use of cryosurgery.

2. **Smooth cervical surface without deep crevices (Option B):** Cryosurgery is most effective when the area to be treated has a smooth surface without deep crevices. This allows for uniform application of the cryogen, which is essential for effective treatment. If the cervical surface is irregular with deep crevices, it may be challenging to achieve uniform freezing, which could lead to inadequate treatment. Therefore, this option could indicate an inappropriate use of cryosurgery.

3. **Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia - 3 (Option C):** Cryosurgery is generally used for treating CIN 2 and CIN 3 lesions. It is not typically used for CIN 1 because the risk of recurrence is higher, and other treatment options may be preferred. However, CIN 3 can be treated with cryosurgery, making this option incorrect as the answer.

4. **CIN limited to two quadrants of the cervix (Option D):** Cryosurgery can be used to treat lesions that are limited to two quadrants of the cervix. This is a suitable indication for cryosurgery because the area to be treated is small and manageable, allowing for effective application of the cryogen.

Considering the above points, the most appropriate answer is B because a smooth cervical surface without deep crevices is a prerequisite for effective cryosurgery.

A. Pyknosis: This term refers to the process of nuclear shrinkage and condensation, often seen in apoptosis (programmed cell death). It's a sign that the cell is undergoing cell death, but the nucleus hasn't yet disintegrated or dissolved.

B. Karyorrhexis: This option describes the fragmentation of the nucleus, where the condensed nucleus breaks apart into smaller, irregular pieces. It's a step further than pyknosis in the process of cell death, indicating that the cell's nucleus is starting to break down, but it's still a process of fragmentation rather than dissolution.

C. Karyolysis: This term specifically refers to the dissolution or liquefaction of the nucleus. It indicates that the nucleus has lost its integrity, its chromatin has broken down, and the nucleus is essentially dissolved. This is a hallmark of advanced cell death or necrosis, where cellular enzymes break down the nucleus and other cellular components.

D. None of the above: This option is used to dismiss all other choices as incorrect, but based on the definitions above, one of the options directly describes the dissolution of the nucleus.

Given the definitions, the term that best describes the nuclear dissolution is C. Karyolysis.

868,In volume cycled ventilation the inspiratory' flow rate is set at:,"['140-160 L/min', '110-130L/min', '60-100 L/min', '30-50L/mm']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider how volume-cycled ventilation works. In volume-cycled ventilation, the ventilator delivers a set tidal volume (the amount of air that moves in and out of the lungs) regardless of the time required to achieve that volume. This means that the ventilator will continue to deliver air at a constant flow rate until the set tidal volume is reached.

Typically, volume-cycled ventilation requires a higher flow rate to ensure that the set tidal volume is reached within a reasonable time, especially for patients who require higher tidal volumes or have higher respiratory rates.

Considering the options provided:
A. 140-160 L/min - This flow rate is consistent with the requirements for volume-cycled ventilation, especially for patients who require higher tidal volumes or have higher respiratory rates.
B. 110-130 L/min - This flow rate might be adequate for some patients but is lower than what is typically used for volume-cycled ventilation.
C. 60-100 L/min - This flow rate is typically more aligned with pressure-controlled ventilation or for patients who do not require high tidal volumes.
D. 30-50 L/min - This flow rate is generally too low for volume-cycled ventilation.

870,Not a marker for hyperparathyroidism is :,"['Increase in serum calcium', 'Increase in 24 hour urinary calcium excretion', 'Decrease in serum calcitonin', 'Subperiosteal resorption of phalanges']","To answer this question, we need to determine which of the options is NOT a marker for hyperparathyroidism.

A. Increase in serum calcium - This is a marker for hyperparathyroidism, as elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels can lead to increased calcium levels in the blood.

B. Increase in 24 hour urinary calcium excretion - This is also a marker for hyperparathyroidism, as the kidneys excrete more calcium in the urine in response to increased PTH levels.

D. Subperiosteal resorption of phalanges - This is a classic radiographic finding in hyperparathyroidism, caused by the increased bone resorption activity of PTH.

C. Decrease in serum calcitonin - This is the correct answer. In hyperparathyroidism, serum calcitonin levels are typically normal or even decreased, as PTH and calcitonin have opposing effects on calcium levels in the body. However, a decrease in serum calcitonin is not a specific or sensitive marker for hyperparathyroidism, whereas the other options are more directly related to the effects of elevated PTH.

874,Failure to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration following birth is clinically k/a –,"['Birth asphyxia', 'RDS–Respiratory distress syndrome', 'Respiratory failure', 'Pulmonary oedema']","To answer this question, let's break it down:

The question is asking about a condition that affects a newborn's ability to breathe on their own after birth. 

- Birth asphyxia (A) refers to a condition where a baby does not receive enough oxygen before, during, or just after birth. While it can lead to breathing difficulties, it's not a direct result of the baby's inability to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration.

- RDS (Respiratory Distress Syndrome) (B) is a condition that affects premature infants, causing them to have difficulty breathing due to a lack of surfactant in their lungs. This condition can indeed lead to failure to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration, especially in premature infants.

- Respiratory failure (C) is a broad term that can refer to a variety of conditions where the lungs are not able to take in enough oxygen or remove enough carbon dioxide. This is not a specific condition directly related to the initiation and maintenance of spontaneous respiration following birth.

- Pulmonary edema (D) is a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. While it can lead to breathing difficulties, it's not a direct result of a newborn's inability to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration.

Given the options, RDS (Respiratory Distress Syndrome) (B) is the most directly related condition to the failure to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration following birth.

A d-xylose absorption test was ordered to look for:,"['Carbohydrate malabsorption due to mucosa] disease', 'Carbohydrate malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis', 'Fat malabsorption due to mucosal disease', 'Fat malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis']","To answer this question, let's understand the purpose of the d-xylose absorption test.

The d-xylose absorption test is used to assess the integrity of the small intestine's mucosal lining. It measures the body's ability to absorb carbohydrates, specifically d-xylose, a simple sugar that is easily absorbed by the small intestine. When d-xylose is ingested, it is absorbed by the small intestine and then excreted in the urine. If the small intestine's mucosa is damaged (e.g., due to inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other mucosal diseases), the body's ability to absorb d-xylose is impaired, leading to its presence in the urine in abnormally low concentrations.

Given the patient's chronic diarrhea, a common cause is mucosal disease, which can lead to malabsorption of carbohydrates.

Options B and D are incorrect because the d-xylose absorption test is not primarily used to diagnose malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis, which affects fat digestion.

Ptosis is a drooping or falling of the upper eyelid. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including neurological conditions, muscle weakness, or trauma to the eye area.

The cranial nerves are responsible for controlling different functions in the body, including eye movement. The 3rd cranial nerve, or oculomotor nerve, controls most of the eye muscles, including the levator palpebrae superioris, which is responsible for elevating the eyelid.

The 4th cranial nerve, or trochlear nerve, controls the superior oblique muscle, which rotates the eye and moves it downward. The 5th cranial nerve, or trigeminal nerve, controls the muscles of facial expression, but not eyelid movement. The 6th cranial nerve, or abducens nerve, controls the lateral rectus muscle, which rotates the eye outward.

Given this information, the correct answer is the option that involves the 3rd cranial nerve, as it is the nerve that controls the muscles responsible for eyelid movement.

The inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery, supplies the lower part of the rectus abdominis muscle. In the rectus sheath, the superior epigastric artery anastomoses with the inferior epigastric artery.

Given this information, let's evaluate the options:

A. Subclavian artery: This is a major artery that arises from the aortic arch and supplies the upper limb and part of the thoracic wall. It is not directly related to the rectus sheath or the superior epigastric artery.

B. External iliac artery: This is the correct answer. The inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery, anastomoses with the superior epigastric artery in the rectus sheath.

C. Internal iliac artery: This artery supplies the pelvic wall and the viscera of the pelvic cavity. It is not directly related to the rectus sheath or the superior epigastric artery.

D. External carotid artery: This artery supplies the head and neck region. It is not related to the rectus sheath or the superior epigastric artery.

932,Neurofibromatosis 1 criteria include all except:,"['Brain tumor', 'Acoustic neuromas', 'Dysplasia of the sphenoidal and tibial bone', 'Cafe-au-lait spots']","To answer this question, let's go through the options and evaluate them in relation to Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) criteria.

NF1, also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple noncancerous (benign) tumors of nerves and skin (neurofibromas) and areas of abnormal skin color. The diagnostic criteria for NF1 include:

- Multiple cafe-au-lait macules (at least 6, with at least one macule > 5 cm in prepubertal individuals or > 15 cm in adults)
- Multiple neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma
- Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions
- Optic glioma
- Two or more of the following: Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas), osseous manifestations (e.g., sphenoid dysplasia, tibial pseudarthrosis), or a first-degree relative with NF1

Looking at the options:

A. Brain tumor - Optic glioma is indeed a type of brain tumor associated with NF1, so this is not an exception.

B. Acoustic neuromas - Acoustic neuromas (also known as vestibular schwannomas) are more commonly associated with Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), not NF1.

C. Dysplasia of the sphenoidal and tibial bone - NF1 can involve osseous manifestations, including dysplasia of the sphenoid bone and tibial pseudarthrosis, so this is not an exception.

D. Cafe-au-lait spots - Cafe-au-lait spots are a hallmark diagnostic criterion for NF1.

Given this information, the correct answer is the option that is not a criterion for Neurofibromatosis 1.

933,Investigation of choice for intramedullary SOL is -,"['MRI', 'USG', 'CT', 'X-ray']","To determine the investigation of choice for an intramedullary spinal cord lesion (SOL), we must consider the characteristics of each imaging modality and their strengths in visualizing the spinal cord.

- **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for visualizing the spinal cord and its contents, including the soft tissues of the spinal cord itself. It provides excellent detail of the cord's structure and is particularly useful for identifying lesions within the spinal cord, such as tumors, hemorrhages, and cysts. MRI can also help differentiate between various types of lesions based on their signal characteristics, which is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning.

- **USG (Ultrasonography)**: While USG is excellent for examining superficial structures and certain soft tissues, its utility in examining the spinal cord, especially for intramedullary lesions, is limited due to the cord's location within the bony spinal canal. The spinal cord's proximity to the vertebral bodies and the air-filled vertebral bodies themselves create significant acoustic impedance, making it difficult to obtain clear images with USG. Therefore, USG is not typically used for this purpose.

- **CT (Computed Tomography)**: CT scans are excellent for visualizing bone and can help identify bony abnormalities or metastatic disease within the spine. However, for soft tissue lesions within the spinal cord itself, CT is less sensitive than MRI. It is more useful in identifying calcifications or bony changes associated with spinal lesions rather than the soft tissue lesions within the cord.

- **X-ray**: X-rays are primarily used for assessing bone density and structural integrity. They can help identify bony abnormalities such as fractures, osteoporosis, or metastatic lesions within the bones of the spine. However, they are not useful for visualizing the soft tissues of the spinal cord or identifying intramedullary lesions.

Considering these points, the most appropriate investigation for an intramedullary spinal cord lesion would be **MRI**, as it offers the best resolution and detail of soft tissue structures within the spinal cord.

Diagnosis ?","['N. gonococci', 'Syphilis', 'LGV', 'Chaneroid']","To diagnose the condition of the sex worker with a discharging ulcer, gram-negative diplococci, and growth on modified Thayer-Martin media, we need to consider the characteristics of the organism and the presentation.

The presence of gram-negative diplococci is a key feature, and when combined with growth on modified Thayer-Martin media, this is highly suggestive of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea.

- **Gonorrhea (N. gonococci)**: This is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It can cause symptoms in both men and women, including a discharging urethral ulcer in men, and in women, it can cause symptoms like vaginal discharge, pain during urination, and pelvic pain. The presence of gram-negative diplococci in the discharge and growth on Thayer-Martin agar are diagnostic for gonorrhea.

- **Syphilis (B)**: Caused by Treponema pallidum, syphilis is another sexually transmitted infection. It can cause a primary chancre, which is a painless ulcer. However, the described characteristics (gram-negative diplococci and growth on modified Thayer-Martin media) do not match syphilis.

- **LGV (C)**: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis. It typically presents with a small painless lesion that may go unnoticed, followed by lymphadenopathy. The described characteristics do not match LGV.

- **Chancroid (D)**: Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. It presents with one or more painful ulcers and tender lymphadenopathy. The described characteristics (gram-negative diplococci and growth on modified Thayer-Martin media) do not match chancroid.

940,How much Potassium is present in the Ringer Lactate solution -,"['1 mEq/L', '4 mEq/L', '2 mEq/L', '6 mEq/L']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the composition of Ringer Lactate solution. Ringer Lactate solution, also known as Lactated Ringer's solution, is a type of intravenous fluid. It's commonly used for fluid resuscitation and to correct electrolyte imbalances. The typical composition of Ringer Lactate solution includes:

- Sodium chloride (NaCl): 6 grams/L
- Sodium lactate: 3.1 grams/L
- Calcium chloride: 0.2 grams/L
- Potassium chloride: 0.3 grams/L

Given the composition, let's calculate the amount of potassium (K+) in milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L):

The molecular weight of potassium chloride (KCl) is approximately 74.55 g/mol (39.1 for K+ and 35.45 for Cl-). Since the solution contains 0.3 grams/L of KCl, we can calculate the amount of potassium as follows:

1. Convert grams of KCl to moles per liter: 0.3 g/L / 74.55 g/mol = 0.004 mol/L (approximately)
2. Multiply the number of moles by the valence (charge) of potassium to get the mEq/L: 0.004 mol/L * 1 (since K+ has a +1 charge) = 0.004 mEq/L

However, this calculation is based on a simplified approximation and doesn't fully account for the molar mass of KCl in relation to the amount of potassium ions in solution. A more accurate way to determine the potassium content is to consider the composition in terms of milliequivalents per liter directly, as it reflects the actual amount of potassium ions available to contribute to the solution's osmotic balance.

Ringer Lactate solution typically contains 4 mEq/L of potassium (K+) because of the 0.3 grams/L of potassium chloride (KCl) it includes, which is directly equivalent to 4 mEq/L since 1 gram of KCl = 4 mEq of K+.

Bitemporal hemianopic field defect refers to a loss of vision in the outer half of both eyes. This type of defect is typically associated with lesions that affect the optic chiasm.

Option A, glaucoma, is a condition that affects the optic nerve and can cause vision loss, but it's not typically associated with bitemporal hemianopia.

Option B, optic neuritis, is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause vision loss, but it's usually unilateral and doesn't typically cause bitemporal hemianopia.

Option C, pituitary tumor, is a mass that grows in the pituitary gland, which is located near the optic chiasm. A pituitary tumor can compress the optic chiasm and cause bitemporal hemianopic field defects.

Option D, retinal detachment, is a condition where the retina separates from the underlying tissue and can cause vision loss, but it's not typically associated with bitemporal hemianopia.

Given this information, the correct answer is C, pituitary tumor, as it is the most likely cause of bitemporal hemianopic field defects.

943,During intraoperative period following capnograph waveform is seen. What does it signify.,"['Return of spontaneous ventilation', 'Airway obstruction', 'Hyperventilation', 'Oesophageal intubation']","To answer this question, we need to analyze the capnograph waveform, which is a graphical representation of the carbon dioxide concentration in exhaled breath. Each waveform has specific characteristics that correspond to different clinical scenarios.

Option A, ""Return of spontaneous ventilation,"" is incorrect because this would be represented by a sudden drop in the capnograph waveform, indicating that the patient is starting to breathe on their own.

Option C, ""Hyperventilation,"" is also incorrect. Hyperventilation would be represented by a more rapid increase in the capnograph waveform, indicating more rapid expiration.

Option D, ""Oesophageal intubation,"" is incorrect because an oesophageal intubation would not produce any capnograph waveform at all, as the tube would be in the oesophagus and not in the trachea.

Option B, ""Airway obstruction,"" is the most likely correct answer. An airway obstruction would cause the capnograph waveform to be biphasic, with a rapid increase in the initial part of the waveform (the dead space phase) followed by a slower increase (the alveolar phase). This represents the obstruction of air flowing through the airways, causing the CO2 to build up in the exhaled breath.

1. The person works in an abattoir, which is a slaughterhouse. This environment is associated with exposure to various zoonotic pathogens, meaning diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans.
2. The person presents with a pustule on their hand that turned into an ulcer. This progression suggests a skin infection, possibly caused by a bacterium or a fungal agent.
3. We need to determine which staining technique would best help in diagnosing the causative agent.

Considering the options provided:

A. Polychrome methylene blue (also known as methylene blue staining) is a simple and quick staining method used for differentiating between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is also used to identify certain types of bacteria, including those that cause skin infections.

B. Carbol fuchsin is used in the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, which is primarily used to identify acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While this is a crucial diagnostic tool, it is less likely to be the best choice for this scenario, given the clinical presentation.

C. Acid-fast stain is, again, primarily used to identify acid-fast bacteria, such as those in the genus Mycobacterium. This would be less relevant for a skin infection in an abattoir worker.

D. Calcofluor white is a fluorescent dye used to stain fungi and fungal elements, making it useful for detecting fungal infections. However, given the context of working in an abattoir and the presentation of a pustule turning into an ulcer, a bacterial infection is more likely.

Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?","['Allopurinol', 'Aspirin', 'Colchicine', 'Probenecid']","To answer this question, let's break down the key details from the scenario:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has a severely inflamed and painful right great toe, which is a classic symptom of gout. The symptoms worsened during a flight, which can be a factor in gout attacks due to changes in pressure and possibly rapid changes in blood flow.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of swelling, erythema (redness due to inflammation), and nodules (tophi) on the external ear (helix) is characteristic of gout. Tophi are deposits of monosodium urate crystals and can be seen in chronic gout.

3. **Diagnostic Findings**: The demonstration of needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate is diagnostic for gout. This finding is crucial for distinguishing gout from other causes of joint inflammation.

Given the diagnosis of acute gout, the immediate goal is to alleviate the pain and inflammation. Let's review the options:

- **A. Allopurinol**: This is a urate-lowering therapy (ULT) used to prevent gout attacks but does not provide immediate relief for an acute attack.
  
- **B. Aspirin**: While aspirin can have anti-inflammatory effects, it is not the first-line treatment for acute gout due to its low dose of salicylate, which is less effective for gout than other NSAIDs or colchicine.

- **C. Colchicine**: This is the correct answer. Colchicine is a specific and effective medication for treating acute gout attacks. It is particularly useful in cases where NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated. Colchicine works by inhibiting microtubule polymerization, which decreases neutrophil migration and is responsible for the reduction of inflammation seen in gout.

- **D. Probenecid**: Like allopurinol, probenecid is used to lower uric acid levels in the body and prevent gout attacks but does not provide immediate relief during an acute attack.

Which of the following is most likely to be deficient in this case?,"['IgG4', 'IgG3', 'IgG2', 'IgG1']","To approach this question, we need to understand the relationship between immunoglobulins (Ig) and the types of infections they typically protect against.

Immunoglobulins are antibodies produced by the immune system to fight infections. There are five main types of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE. IgG is the most common type of antibody found in the blood, and it's further divided into four subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4.

Sinopulmonary infections, which affect the sinuses and lungs, are often caused by encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. These organisms have a polysaccharide capsule that helps them evade the immune system.

The key to answering this question lies in understanding which class of immunoglobulins is primarily responsible for protecting against encapsulated bacteria. IgG2 is particularly important in this regard, as it is the subclass that provides the best protection against infections caused by encapsulated organisms such as those mentioned above.

Given this information, let's evaluate the options:

A. IgG4: This subclass is not primarily associated with protection against encapsulated bacteria.
B. IgG3: While IgG3 is involved in the immune response, it is not the most relevant subclass in this case.

Devic's disease, also known as Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), is a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the central nervous system. It's characterized by inflammation and damage to the optic nerves and spinal cord, leading to vision loss and weakness in the arms and legs.

The key to answering this question lies in understanding the association between Devic's disease and aquaporin proteins. Aquaporins are a family of proteins that form water channels in the cell membrane, facilitating water transport across the membrane. Different aquaporin proteins are expressed in various tissues and cells throughout the body.

Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is specifically expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the astrocytes that cover the surface of neurons and blood vessels. Research has shown that antibodies against AQP4 are present in the majority of patients with Neuromyelitis Optica (Devic's disease), indicating a pathogenic role of these antibodies in the disease.

Given the options:

A. Aquaporin 0 - Incorrect. Aquaporin 0 is expressed in the lens of the eye, not in the central nervous system.

B. Aquaporin 1 - Incorrect. Aquaporin 1 is found in various tissues, including kidney, lung, and salivary gland, but is not specifically associated with Devic's disease.

956,A 35 year old male presents to the urologist for an infeility evaluation. A biopsy of his testis is performed to check sperm production and maturation. A microscopic section reveals only a few germ cells near the basal lamina in the seminiferous tubule. Which of the following cells is the germ cell closest to the basal lamina in the seminiferous tubule?,"['Primary spermatocyte', 'Secondary spermatocyte', 'Spermatid', 'Spermatogonia']","To answer this question, we need to understand the process of spermatogenesis and the location of each cell type within the seminiferous tubule.

Spermatogenesis is the process by which immature cells, called spermatogonia, develop into mature sperm cells. The process occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testis and involves several stages, including the proliferation of spermatogonia, the meiotic division of primary spermatocytes to form secondary spermatocytes, and the further differentiation of spermatids into mature sperm cells.

Spermatogonia are the immature cells that give rise to the sperm cells. They are located near the basal lamina of the seminiferous tubule, where they undergo mitotic division to produce more spermatogonia and to initiate the spermatogenic process. Primary spermatocytes, which are the product of spermatogonia, are found closer to the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. Secondary spermatocytes and spermatids are also found closer to the lumen, as they are further along in the spermatogenic process.

Given this information, we can conclude that the cell closest to the basal lamina in the seminiferous tubule is the spermatogonium.

959,Thomas splint most troubling is:,"['Ring', 'Side bars', 'Gauze support', 'Traction attachment']","To determine the most troubling aspect of a Thomas splint, let's consider what the splint is designed for and the common issues associated with its use.

A Thomas splint is a type of orthopedic splint used to immobilize and support a leg, particularly the femur (thigh bone). It is commonly used for fractures of the femur. The splint is designed to apply traction to the leg, helping to align and stabilize the fracture, promote healing, and reduce pain.

- **Ring (A):** The ring part of the Thomas splint is crucial as it helps to immobilize the hip and apply traction to the leg. However, it's not typically considered the most troubling aspect.
  
- **Side bars (B):** Side bars are a component of the Thomas splint that help maintain the alignment and stability of the leg. They can sometimes cause discomfort due to pressure on the skin, but they are not the most concerning aspect of the splint.

- **Gauze support (C):** The gauze support within the splint is used for padding and comfort. While it might cause some discomfort if it's not properly fitted or if the patient has a sensitive skin, it's generally not the most troubling aspect.

- **Traction attachment (D):** The traction attachment is the part of the splint that actually applies the traction force to the leg. It's the component that allows for the management of the fracture through controlled tension. However, it can sometimes be too tight or cause discomfort due to the pressure applied, making it the most troubling aspect for patients.

Given these considerations, the most troubling aspect of a Thomas splint, which would likely be a source of discomfort or concern for the patient, is the **traction attachment** because of the potential for it to be too tight or cause pressure on the leg.

Explanation: The chi-square test is a non-parametric test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. One of the key assumptions of the chi-square test is that the categories used in the test must be mutually exclusive and discrete. This means that each observation must belong to only one category, and there should be no overlap between categories. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because the chi-square test is not affected by the number of samples. Option B is incorrect because a p-value of <0.001 is indeed statistically significant, but this is not a unique characteristic of the chi-square test. Option D is incorrect because the chi-square test is used to test for association between variables, not to test for correlation and regression.",D,0.5489297007086704,B,False

962,Nucleic acids absorb UV light maximally at the wavelength of,"['260nm', '280 nm', '410 nm', '320 nm']","To answer this question, let's consider the properties of nucleic acids and how they interact with light.

Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, have a unique chemical structure that includes purine and pyrimidine bases. These bases are responsible for absorbing UV light. The specific wavelength at which nucleic acids absorb UV light is related to the energy levels of the electrons in these bases.

Purine and pyrimidine bases in nucleic acids have a maximum absorption of UV light at around 260 nanometers (nm). This is because the energy from UV light at 260 nm is sufficient to cause electronic transitions in the bases, leading to absorption.

In contrast, wavelengths like 280 nm are associated with the absorption of UV light by aromatic amino acids, such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, which are found in proteins. The wavelength of 410 nm is in the visible light spectrum, and nucleic acids do not absorb light at this wavelength. Similarly, 320 nm is not a specific absorption maximum for nucleic acids.

Given this information, the correct answer is the option that corresponds to 260 nm, which is the wavelength at which nucleic acids absorb UV light maximally.

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and is an essential component of connective tissue, which provides structure and support to various tissues, including skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments.

The cells responsible for producing collagen are called fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are found in connective tissue and play a crucial role in the production of collagen and other extracellular matrix components.

The other options are also cells, but they are specialized for different functions:

- Chondroblasts are cells that produce cartilage.
- Odontoblasts are cells that produce dentin, a hard tissue found in teeth.

A. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is typically self-limiting and not a common cause of chronic viral hepatitis. Chronic viral hepatitis is usually caused by Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatitis D virus (HDV), or Hepatitis E virus (HEV). So, option A is incorrect.

B. Morphological classification of chronic viral hepatitis into Chronic Active Hepatitis (CAH) and Chronic Persistent Hepatitis (CPH) is no longer considered important. CAH is characterized by severe inflammation and piecemeal necrosis of liver cells, whereas CPH is characterized by moderate inflammation and minimal or no piecemeal necrosis. However, this classification system has largely been replaced by more modern classifications that focus on the underlying viral etiology and the degree of liver fibrosis. So, option B is not correct.

C. Fatty change, also known as steatosis, can be seen in various liver conditions, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease. While HCV infection can be associated with steatosis, fatty change is not pathognomonic (unique and diagnostic) of HCV infection. So, option C is incorrect.

D. Grading refers to the assessment of the degree of liver inflammation and necrosis, which is a key component of the modified Histological Activity Index (HAI) used in chronic viral hepatitis. The HAI scores both the degree of inflammation (grading) and the extent of fibrosis (staging). Therefore, option D is correct.

965,All are true regarding Crohn's disease except:,"['Infertility', 'Risk of Ca', 'Medical treatment includes antibiotics, probiotics and TNF alpha blockers', 'ASCA-negative']","To approach this question, let's evaluate each option regarding Crohn's disease:

A. Infertility: This is a known complication of Crohn's disease, particularly in women. The chronic inflammation and malabsorption associated with Crohn's can lead to issues such as irregular periods, anemia, and increased risk of complications in pregnancy. Thus, infertility is indeed a consequence of Crohn's disease, making this statement true.

B. Risk of Ca (Cancer): Patients with Crohn's disease have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to the general population. The chronic inflammation contributes to the carcinogenic process. So, this statement is also true.

C. Medical treatment includes antibiotics, probiotics and TNF alpha blockers: This statement is true as well. Crohn's disease is treated with a variety of medications including antibiotics (for bacterial infections), probiotics (to improve gut flora), and TNF-alpha blockers (biologics that target tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a cytokine involved in the inflammatory process). These treatments aim to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms.

D. ASCA-negative: ASCA stands for Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody, which is a marker that can be positive in Crohn's disease patients. While not all Crohn's patients are positive for ASCA, stating that all Crohn's disease patients are ASCA-negative is incorrect. A significant proportion of patients with Crohn's disease will test positive for ASCA, making this option the exception or the false statement in the context of the question.

The Hering-Breuer inflation reflex and deflation reflex are both involved in the regulation of breathing, but they have opposite effects. The inflation reflex is responsible for preventing overinflation of the lungs by inhibiting inspiration when the lungs are already inflated. The deflation reflex is responsible for stimulating inspiration when the lungs are deflated.

Head's paradoxical reflex is a reflex that is activated when the lungs are overinflated, leading to a further increase in lung volume. This reflex is responsible for explaining why inflation of the lungs can induce further inflation.

J-reflex is not a commonly recognized reflex in the context of breathing regulation.

Given the options, the correct answer is the one that involves the paradoxical increase in lung volume in response to inflation, which is characteristic of Head's paradoxical reflex.

972,All of the following cause hyperventilation except,"['Decreased pH in CSF', 'Decreased plasma HCO3', 'CO poisoning', 'Increased adrenergic levels']","To answer this question, let's evaluate each option in relation to hyperventilation:

A. Decreased pH in CSF: Hyperventilation is often caused by low carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood, which in turn can be caused by decreased pH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This is because low pH in the CSF can stimulate the respiratory centers in the brain to increase breathing rate, leading to hyperventilation. So, this option does cause hyperventilation.

B. Decreased plasma HCO3: This option refers to a decrease in plasma bicarbonate levels. When plasma bicarbonate levels are low, the body may compensate by increasing ventilation to blow off CO2 and restore acid-base balance. Therefore, this option also causes hyperventilation.

C. CO poisoning: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning primarily causes tissue hypoxia by binding to hemoglobin and reducing the amount of oxygen being transported to tissues. While hyperventilation can be a response to the body's attempt to compensate for the lack of oxygen, CO poisoning itself does not directly cause hyperventilation. Instead, it's more of an indirect consequence of the body's response to the lack of oxygen.

D. Increased adrenergic levels: Increased levels of adrenergic substances (like epinephrine) can stimulate the respiratory centers in the brain, leading to an increase in breathing rate. This is a known physiological response to stress or panic, and it can indeed cause hyperventilation.

Given the information above, the correct answer is C, as CO poisoning is not a direct cause of hyperventilation but rather a condition that may indirectly lead to hyperventilation as a compensatory response.

973,Pain relief in chronic pancreatitis can be obtained by destruction of,"['Celiac ganglia', 'Vagus nerve', 'Anterolateral column of spinal cord', 'None of the above']","To address this question, let's consider the management of chronic pancreatitis and the role of pain relief in its treatment.

Chronic pancreatitis often leads to severe abdominal pain, which can be debilitating and significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Given that the pain is often due to inflammation and scarring of the pancreas, treatments focus on managing symptoms rather than curing the condition.

Options for managing chronic pancreatitis pain include pharmacological interventions, such as analgesics and pancreatic enzyme supplements, as well as interventional procedures. 

Among the interventional procedures, celiac plexus block or neurolysis (destruction) is often considered for patients with severe pain due to its ability to interrupt pain signals from the pancreas. The celiac ganglia are part of the celiac plexus, which contains nerves transmitting pain signals from the abdominal organs, including the pancreas.

Therefore, the destruction of the celiac ganglia is a procedure aimed at providing long-term pain relief in patients with chronic pancreatitis.

980,Stem cells are present where in cornea -,"['Limbus', 'Stroma', 'Epithelium', ""Descmet's membrane""]","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the anatomy and function of the cornea and the characteristics of stem cells.

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have the ability to differentiate into various cell types. In the context of the cornea, stem cells are crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the corneal epithelium, the outermost layer of the cornea.

The limbus, which is the border between the cornea and the sclera (the white part of the eye), is known to be the location of stem cells for the cornea. These stem cells reside in the basal layer of the limbal epithelium and are responsible for regenerating and replacing the corneal epithelial cells that wear out due to friction, injury, or disease.

The stroma (Option B) is the middle layer of the cornea, consisting of densely packed collagen fibers and cells called keratocytes. While the stroma is crucial for the cornea's transparency and strength, it is not where stem cells are primarily located.

The epithelium (Option C) is the outermost layer of the cornea, composed of multiple layers of cells. Although the epithelium is the layer where stem cells act to regenerate cells, the stem cells themselves are not located within the epithelium but rather in the limbus, where they can migrate to the epithelium to replace worn-out cells.

Descemet's membrane (Option D) is a thin layer of tissue located between the stroma and the endothelium (the innermost layer of the cornea). It is produced by the endothelial cells and serves as a protective barrier. However, it is not associated with stem cells.

Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes that can lead to kidney damage and failure. Microalbuminuria, or the presence of small amounts of albumin in the urine, is an early indicator of diabetic nephropathy and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

B-islet cell/pancreatic transplantation can improve glycemic control and reduce proteinuria in early-stage diabetic nephropathy. This is because the transplanted islet cells can produce insulin, reducing glucose levels and associated kidney damage.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are a class of medications that can help slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy by reducing proteinuria and blood pressure. While they do have a beneficial effect on blood pressure, they also have an additive effect on reducing proteinuria beyond blood pressure control alone.

986,Which of the following is an adrenergic drug preferred for arresting labour?,"['Ritodrine', 'Isoprenaline', 'Salbutamol', 'Terbutaline']","To answer this question, we need to consider the pharmacological properties of the adrenergic drugs listed and their typical uses.

Ritodrine (A) is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist that has been used to relax the uterus and delay premature labor. It's specifically used for this purpose.

Isoprenaline (B) is a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist with both beta-1 and beta-2 effects. While it does have some uterine relaxation effect, it's not as specifically used for arresting labor as some other drugs.

Salbutamol (C) is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist primarily used for bronchodilation in asthma. It's not typically used for arresting labor.

Terbutaline (D) is also a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, similar to Salbutamol, and used for bronchodilation in asthma. Like Salbutamol, it's not typically used for arresting labor.

Given the specific use of Ritodrine for arresting labor, it's the most appropriate choice.

A. Median umbilical fold is obliterated to become urachus in adults - This statement is true. The urachus is a remnant of the allantois, which is a structure that connects the bladder to the umbilicus during fetal development. In adults, the urachus is usually a fibrous cord that connects the bladder to the umbilicus, and it is indeed related to the median umbilical fold.

B. Medial umbilical fold is peritoneal fold on medial umbilical ligament - This statement is true. The medial umbilical folds are peritoneal folds that cover the medial umbilical ligaments, which are remnants of the umbilical arteries.

C. Medial umbilical fold covers allantois - This statement is false. The median umbilical fold actually covers the urachus, not the allantois. The allantois is a different embryological structure that gives rise to the urachus.

D. Lateral umbilical fold produced by inferior epigastric vessels - This statement is true. The lateral umbilical folds are indeed produced by the inferior epigastric vessels.

988,A volunteer Ram will receive a new drug in a phase I clinical trial. The clearance and the volume of distribution of the drug in Ram are 1.386 I/hr and 80 L respectively. The half life of the drug in him would be approximately:,"['83 hr', '77 hr', '40 hr', '0.02 hr']","To determine the half-life of the drug, we can use the formula:

Half-life (t1/2) = (0.693 x Volume of distribution) / Clearance

Given values:
Volume of distribution (Vd) = 80 L
Clearance (Cl) = 1.386 L/hr

Substituting the values into the formula:

t1/2 = (0.693 x 80 L) / 1.386 L/hr
t1/2 ≈ 39.73 hr

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get approximately 40 hr.

989,Characteristic visual field defect in optic chiasma lesion -,"['Homonymous hemianopia', 'Bitemporal hemianopia', 'Upper quadrantanopia', 'Lower quadrantanopia']","To determine the characteristic visual field defect in an optic chiasma lesion, let's consider the anatomy and function of the optic chiasm. The optic chiasm is the part of the brain where the optic nerves (carrying visual information from each eye) partially cross over. This crossing of fibers allows for the combination of visual information from both eyes to be processed in the brain.

A lesion in the optic chiasm typically affects the crossing fibers, which are responsible for carrying information from the nasal hemiretina of each eye. The nasal hemiretina is responsible for transmitting visual information from the temporal (outer) fields of vision.

Given this information, the characteristic visual field defect in an optic chiasma lesion would be a loss of vision in the temporal fields of both eyes, which is known as bitemporal hemianopia.

991,Sixth cranial nerve palsy causes of left eye causes?,"['Accomodation paresis in left gaze', 'Ptosis of left eye', 'Adduction weakness of left eye', 'Diplopia in left gaze']","The sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) is responsible for controlling the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye (moves it outward, away from the midline). If the sixth cranial nerve is affected, it can cause difficulty moving the eye outward, leading to symptoms such as diplopia (double vision) in the direction of the gaze (in this case, left gaze).

Option A, Accommodation paresis in left gaze, is incorrect because the sixth cranial nerve is not involved in accommodation (focusing).

Option B, Ptosis of left eye, is incorrect because the sixth cranial nerve is not responsible for controlling the eyelid muscles, which are controlled by the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve).

Option C, Adduction weakness of left eye, is incorrect because the sixth cranial nerve is responsible for abducting the eye (moving it outward), not adducting it (moving it inward), which is controlled by the sixth cranial nerve's counterpart, the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve), through the medial rectus muscle.

Option D, Diplopia in left gaze, is the correct answer because the sixth cranial nerve palsy causes difficulty moving the eye outward, leading to double vision when trying to gaze in that direction.

994,In the stage of Grey hepatization-,"[""WBC's fill the alveoli"", ""RBC's fill the alveoli"", 'Organisms fill the alveoli', 'Accumulation of fibrin']","To answer this question, let's break down the stages of pneumonia, which is what ""Grey hepatization"" refers to.

Grey hepatization is a stage of lobar pneumonia, characterized by a greyish liver-like appearance of the lung. This stage occurs after the consolidation of the lung, which happens in the red hepatization stage.

During the grey hepatization stage:

- The alveoli and bronchioles are filled with fibrinogen, which is converted into fibrin, a protein that forms a network of fibers.
- This fibrin network traps neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell.
- As a result, the lung tissue takes on a greyish color due to the presence of fibrin and neutrophils.

Given the options, the correct answer reflects the presence of fibrin, which is the hallmark of the grey hepatization stage.

995,Treatment of acute asthma include all except-,"['Prednisolone', 'Salbutamol', 'Salmeterol', 'Ipratropium bromide']","For acute asthma treatment, we want to focus on medications that provide quick relief and control symptoms.

A. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid, which is often used in acute asthma to reduce inflammation. So, it's a good option.

B. Salbutamol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist, which helps to relax the muscles in the airways and improve breathing. It's a key medication for acute asthma attacks.

D. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that can help to relax the muscles in the airways and improve breathing. It's often used in combination with other medications for acute asthma.

C. Salmeterol, on the other hand, is a long-acting beta-2 agonist, which is used to control symptoms over a longer period. However, it's not typically used for the immediate relief of acute asthma attacks because its effects take longer to kick in.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, as Salmeterol is not typically used for the treatment of acute asthma.

Superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two or more ova from the same menstrual cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, resulting in twins or multiple gestations where the embryos are conceived at different times, but within a short period.

Superfetation, on the other hand, is the development of a fetus while another fetus is already in the womb. This occurs when a new oocyte (egg) is released and fertilized while a pregnancy is already in progress, resulting in two embryos developing at different times.

Given the scenario of a twin pregnancy with two different men, it is most likely that the pregnancy resulted from two different instances of fertilization, not from the development of a new fetus while an existing one was still in the womb.

The electrolyte abnormality seen in him would be -","['Hypokalemia', 'Hyperkalemia', 'Hypocalcaemia', 'Hypercalcemia']","To determine the correct answer, we should consider the relationship between bronchogenic carcinoma and the symptoms described, as well as the electrolyte abnormalities listed.

Bronchogenic carcinoma, a type of lung cancer, can lead to several paraneoplastic syndromes, which are conditions caused by the body's reaction to the cancer but not due to direct local effects of the cancer cells. One well-documented paraneoplastic syndrome associated with lung cancer, especially squamous cell carcinoma, is hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Hypercalcemia in this context is usually caused by the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by the tumor. This leads to an increase in calcium levels in the blood, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including polyuria (excessive urine production), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and altered sensorium (a change in the level of consciousness or confusion).

Considering the options provided:

A. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) can be associated with several conditions but is not the most direct link to the symptoms described in the context of bronchogenic carcinoma.
B. Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) is not typically associated with the symptoms described or with lung cancer directly.
C. Hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) is the opposite of what is expected in this scenario.
D. Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) is the correct answer due to its direct association with bronchogenic carcinoma, particularly through the mechanism of paraneoplastic syndromes like those caused by PTHrP.

Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is the first-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, are effective in reducing the symptoms of OCD and are generally well-tolerated.

Clomipramine (Option A) is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that can also be effective in treating OCD, but it is not typically considered the first-line treatment due to its side effect profile and the availability of SSRIs.

Carbamazepine (Option C) is an anticonvulsant medication that is primarily used to treat seizure disorders, and it is not typically used to treat OCD.

Chlorpromazine (Option D) is an antipsychotic medication that is primarily used to treat psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and is not typically used to treat OCD.

Hypertrophy refers to the growth and enlargement of cells, which results in an increase in the size of an organ or tissue. This is typically a response to increased workload or demand, such as when muscles are exercised regularly and grow in size.

With that in mind, let's evaluate the options:

A. Increased protein content of the cells - While it's true that cells may contain more protein as a result of hypertrophy, this option doesn't directly address the definition of hypertrophy.

B. Increase in size of cells - This option aligns perfectly with the definition of hypertrophy, which is an increase in size of cells.

C. Increase in number of cells - This is actually the definition of hyperplasia, not hypertrophy. Hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells.

D. None of the above - Based on our analysis, option B is correct, so this option is not applicable.

a) Sulfonamides: Sulfonamides are a group of antimicrobials that inhibit the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF), a form of folic acid. This is a correct association.

b) Methotrexate: Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that specifically inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme crucial for the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. This is a correct association.

c) Nitrous oxide: Nitrous oxide is a gas used for analgesia and sedation in medical procedures. It can interfere with vitamin B12 metabolism, which is related to folic acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 and folic acid are both essential for DNA synthesis and repair, and their metabolism is interrelated. Therefore, nitrous oxide can indirectly affect folic acid metabolism by impairing vitamin B12 metabolism.

d) Trimethoprim: Trimethoprim is another antimetabolite that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), similar to methotrexate. This is a correct association.

e) 5–Flucytosine: 5-Flucytosine is an antifungal medication that interferes with DNA synthesis in fungi by being converted into 5-fluorouracil inside fungal cells. It doesn't directly inhibit folic acid metabolism but rather interferes with DNA synthesis, which is a different mechanism.

Given the information, options a, b, c, and d are correctly associated with inhibiting folic acid metabolism through different mechanisms. Option e is not directly involved in inhibiting folic acid metabolism.

Let's analyze the options:

A. Glycogen - Glycogen is a form of carbohydrate storage found in cells, especially in the liver and muscles. PAS staining is positive for glycogen, so this option is not correct for the answer we're looking for.

B. Lipids - Lipids are not stained by PAS. PAS reacts with carbohydrates, not lipids. This makes option B a potential correct answer.

C. Fungal cell wall - Fungal cell walls often contain polysaccharides that are PAS positive, such as glucans. This option is incorrect because it is an example of something that is PAS positive.

D. Basement membrane of bacteria - This option is somewhat unclear, but if it's referring to structures around bacterial cells, the basement membrane is not a term typically associated with bacterial cells, and PAS positivity is not a characteristic of bacterial cell walls.

1015,Risk factor prevention at which level,"['Primordial', 'Primary', 'Secondary', 'Tertiary']","To answer this question, we need to understand the different levels of risk factor prevention. Here's a brief overview:

- **Primordial prevention** refers to actions taken to prevent the emergence of risk factors themselves, rather than the diseases they cause. This level aims to prevent the development of risk factors in the first place, essentially preventing the need for further prevention levels.

- **Primary prevention** targets the risk factors directly, preventing diseases from occurring in the first place. This can include vaccination, healthy diet, exercise, and other measures to prevent the onset of diseases.

- **Secondary prevention** focuses on early detection and treatment of diseases before symptoms appear. This usually involves screening tests and regular health checks to identify and manage conditions before they become severe.

- **Tertiary prevention** aims to soften the impact of an ongoing illness or injury that has lasting effects. This includes rehabilitation, management of chronic conditions, and reducing the complications of diseases.

1016,"Patient with fixed dilated pupil, with iris atrophy and secondary glaucoma after penetrating keratoplasty is suggestive of:","[""Benedict's syndrome"", 'Posner-Shlossman syndrome', ""Kaufmann's syndrome"", 'Urrets Zavalia syndrome']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the key components of the question and analyze them in relation to the options provided:

1. **Fixed dilated pupil**: This symptom suggests an issue with the autonomic nervous system or a condition affecting the iris or the nerves controlling pupil movement.

2. **Iris atrophy**: This indicates damage or degeneration of the iris tissue, which could be due to various causes including trauma, inflammation, or previous surgeries.

3. **Secondary glaucoma after penetrating keratoplasty**: This suggests a complication arising from the surgery, which could be due to the surgery itself, the body's reaction to the surgery, or pre-existing conditions.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. **Benedict's syndrome**: This is a rare condition characterized by a combination of oculomotor nerve palsy (leading to dilated pupil), contralateral hemiparesis, and personality changes. It's more related to neurological complications rather than surgical complications like glaucoma or iris atrophy.

B. **Posner-Shlossman syndrome**: Also known as glaucomatocyclitic crisis, it's characterized by recurrent, unilateral episodes of mild glaucoma and a mid-dilated pupil, but it's not specifically associated with iris atrophy or directly linked to penetrating keratoplasty.

C. **Kaufmann's syndrome**: There isn't a widely recognized medical condition by this name directly associated with the symptoms described, especially in relation to penetrating keratoplasty and iris atrophy.

D. **Urrets Zavalia syndrome**: This is a rare condition characterized by a fixed dilated pupil, often after ocular surgery such as penetrating keratoplasty, associated with secondary glaucoma and iris atrophy. It's considered a complication of ocular surgery that fits the described scenario.

Given the description of the symptoms and the options, **D. Urrets Zavalia syndrome** is the most appropriate answer because it directly correlates with a fixed dilated pupil, secondary glaucoma, and iris atrophy following penetrating keratoplasty.

1023,B cell prolymphocytic leukemia patients differ from those with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in,"['Presenting at a younger age', 'Having a lower total leucocyte count', 'Having prominent lymphadenopathy', 'Having a shorter survival']","To answer this question, let's break down the key differences between B cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).

1. **Age at Presentation**: B-PLL tends to present at a younger age compared to B-CLL. B-CLL is more common in older adults, typically above the age of 60. In contrast, B-PLL can occur at any age, including younger individuals, but it is indeed less common in the elderly.

2. **Total Leucocyte Count (TLC)**: B-PLL is characterized by a higher TLC compared to B-CLL. While B-CLL often presents with a low or normal TLC, B-PLL is marked by a higher white blood cell count, sometimes exceeding 100,000 cells per microliter. This high count is one of the distinguishing features that separates B-PLL from B-CLL.

3. **Lymphadenopathy**: Both B-PLL and B-CLL can present with lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the lymph nodes), but this is not a distinguishing feature between the two conditions. Lymphadenopathy is a common symptom in many types of lymphoma and leukemia, including B-CLL and B-PLL.

4. **Survival**: The prognosis and survival of patients with B-PLL are generally worse compared to those with B-CLL. B-PLL is considered an aggressive leukemia, with a poorer response to treatment and a shorter survival rate compared to B-CLL.

Based on the options provided:

- **A** (Presenting at a younger age) is correct because B-PLL tends to occur in younger individuals compared to B-CLL.
- **B** (Having a lower total leucocyte count) is incorrect because B-PLL is characterized by a higher TLC.
- **C** (Having prominent lymphadenopathy) is not a distinguishing feature between B-PLL and B-CLL, making it an incorrect answer.
- **D** (Having a shorter survival) is incorrect because B-CLL generally has a better prognosis and longer survival rate than B-PLL.

1029,Negative nitrogen balance is the characteristic feature of which phase of convalescence after surgery?,"['Catabolic phase', 'Anabolic phase', 'Fat gain phase', 'Tuning point phase']","To answer this question, let's break down the phases of convalescence after surgery:

1. **Catabolic phase**: This is the initial phase of recovery, usually occurring within the first few days after surgery. During this phase, the body breaks down muscle and tissue to repair and replace damaged tissues. A negative nitrogen balance occurs when the body excretes more nitrogen (a key component of amino acids) than it takes in. This phase is characterized by catabolism, where the body is using stored energy and breaking down tissues to recover. Therefore, a negative nitrogen balance is a hallmark of the catabolic phase.

2. **Anabolic phase**: After the initial catabolic phase, the body enters an anabolic phase, where it starts to rebuild and repair tissues. This phase is characterized by a positive nitrogen balance, indicating that the body is taking in more nitrogen than it is excreting, which is necessary for tissue repair and growth.

3. **Fat gain phase**: While it's true that some patients may gain fat during recovery, the term ""fat gain phase"" is not commonly used to describe a distinct phase of convalescence in the context of post-surgical recovery.

4. **Tuning point phase**: I couldn't find any reference to a ""tuning point phase"" in the medical literature related to postoperative recovery.

Given the information above, the correct answer is the phase associated with a negative nitrogen balance, which is the catabolic phase.

A. Naltrexone - This medication is used to treat alcohol dependence by reducing the craving for alcohol and preventing relapse. It works by blocking the effects of endorphins, which are the body's natural painkillers and can also contribute to the high associated with drinking. Naltrexone is a common treatment for alcohol dependence.

B. Acamprosate - This medication is also used to treat alcohol dependence. It works by reducing cravings for alcohol and preventing relapse. Acamprosate is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcohol withdrawal.

D. Disulfiram - This medication is used to treat chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to ethanol (drinking alcohol). Disulfiram works by inhibiting the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which is involved in the breakdown of alcohol. When alcohol is consumed while taking Disulfiram, it can cause unpleasant symptoms, such as flushing, nausea, and headaches, which discourage drinking.

C. Flumazenil - This medication is used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines, which are a class of drugs that include medications like Xanax, Valium, and Ativan.

A. Elevated 2,3 DPG: In fetal RBCs, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels are actually low, not elevated. 2,3-DPG is an intracellular metabolite that affects hemoglobin's oxygen affinity. Low levels in fetal RBCs contribute to their ability to carry oxygen from the mother's bloodstream to the fetus's tissues.

B. Decreased carbonic anhydrase activity: This statement is true for fetal RBCs. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme involved in the regulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the body, catalyzing the reversible reaction between CO2 and water to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into bicarbonate and a hydrogen ion. Fetal RBCs have lower carbonic anhydrase activity compared to adult RBCs, which helps to regulate the pH and CO2 transport in the fetus.

C. Decreased life span: This is true. Fetal RBCs have a shorter life span compared to adult RBCs. They are produced in the liver and spleen of the fetus and have a lifespan of about 80 days, whereas adult RBCs have a lifespan of about 120 days.

D. High RBC volume: Fetal RBCs do have a higher volume (or size) compared to adult RBCs, which is a characteristic feature. This is due to the need for these cells to carry oxygen across the placenta from the mother's bloodstream to the fetus's tissues.

Given the above explanations, the statement that does not hold true regarding fetal RBCs is A, which incorrectly states that 2,3-DPG levels are elevated in fetal RBCs.

1043,Which is not primary amenorrhea?,"[""Sheehan's syndrome"", ""Kallmann's syndrome"", 'Mayer Rokitansky Koster Hauser syndrome', 'Turner syndrome']","To answer this question, let's first define primary amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is a condition where a female has not experienced her first menstrual period (menarche) by the age of 16 years. It's a condition where there is an absence of menstruation.

Now, let's examine each of the options given:

A. Sheehan's syndrome - This is a condition where a woman's pituitary gland is damaged, usually as a result of severe bleeding during childbirth. It can cause a reduction in the production of several important hormones, which can lead to symptoms such as amenorrhea, but it is not a direct cause of primary amenorrhea. Instead, it is a cause of secondary amenorrhea, which occurs after a person has had their first menstrual period.

B. Kallmann's syndrome - This is a genetic disorder characterized by delayed or absent puberty, which can include primary amenorrhea in females.

C. Mayer Rokitansky Koster Hauser (MRKH) syndrome - This is a rare congenital disorder where the vagina and uterus are either partially or completely missing, leading to primary amenorrhea.

D. Turner syndrome - This is a genetic disorder that affects females, where one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially deleted. It is characterized by short stature, ovarian failure, and primary amenorrhea.

Given the definition of primary amenorrhea and the descriptions of the conditions listed in the options, the condition that is not a primary cause of primary amenorrhea is Sheehan's syndrome, as it typically leads to secondary amenorrhea.

1044,An expansion alliance made with an expansion screw is an example of:,"['Simple anchorage', 'Reciprocal anchorage', 'Multiple anchorage', 'Reinforced anchorage']","To answer this question, let's break down the concepts related to anchorage in orthodontics, which is the field of study where this term is commonly used.

Simple anchorage refers to a situation where the forces exerted by the orthodontic appliances on the teeth are counteracted by the natural resistance of the surrounding bone and periodontal ligament. This doesn't involve the use of additional appliances or components to enhance the anchorage.

Reciprocal anchorage involves the use of two appliances that are designed to work against each other, with one appliance providing the forward forces and the other providing the backward forces. This setup is meant to stabilize the dental arch or to correct specific malocclusions.

Multiple anchorage refers to the use of more than one anchorage unit to provide additional stability and resistance to the forces exerted by orthodontic appliances. This can include the use of additional appliances such as mini-screws, temporary anchorage devices (TADs), or other types of fixation devices.

Reinforced anchorage, in the context of an expansion screw, would imply that the expansion force is amplified or enhanced through additional means beyond the standard anchorage provided by the tooth itself. This can include the use of expansion screws that are anchored in place with additional appliances or devices to increase the force of expansion.

Given the description of an expansion alliance made with an expansion screw, which suggests a mechanism to enhance or amplify the expansion force, this scenario is most closely aligned with the concept of reinforced anchorage. This is because it implies an additional mechanism (the expansion screw and its alliance) is used to amplify the force of expansion.

1045,Day care anesthesia is best achieved with,"['Enflurane', 'Isoflurane', 'Propofol', 'Methoxyflurane']","To determine the best answer, let's consider the characteristics of day care anesthesia and the properties of each option:

Day care anesthesia, also known as outpatient anesthesia, requires a rapid onset, short duration of action, and minimal side effects to allow for quick recovery and discharge. The ideal agent should also have a favorable pharmacokinetic profile for these purposes.

A. Enflurane is an inhalational anesthetic agent but is not the most commonly used or preferred agent for day care anesthesia due to its potential for seizures at high concentrations and its slower recovery profile compared to some other agents.

B. Isoflurane is another inhalational agent that, while safe and effective, is not the best choice for day care procedures due to its relatively slow onset and offset of action, which can prolong recovery.

C. Propofol is a commonly used intravenous anesthetic agent for day care procedures. It has a rapid onset and offset of action, making it ideal for short procedures and quick recovery. It also has antiemetic properties, which reduce the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, a common concern in outpatient settings.

D. Methoxyflurane is an older inhalational anesthetic agent with a slow onset and offset of action, as well as potential nephrotoxicity at high concentrations. It's less commonly used today due to these drawbacks.

Considering the above characteristics, the best option for day care anesthesia, which requires rapid onset, short duration, and minimal side effects, is Propofol.

A. 5' Capping - This is a true statement. 5' capping is a process that occurs during the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, where a modified guanine nucleotide is added to the 5' end of the mRNA molecule. This capping process protects the mRNA from degradation and helps with the initiation of translation.

B. Addition of poly A tail - This is also a true statement. The addition of a poly-A tail to the 3' end of mRNA is another post-transcriptional modification that occurs in eukaryotic cells. This tail is crucial for mRNA stability and export from the nucleus, and it also plays a role in the initiation of translation.

C. Removal of introns - This is a true statement as well. The removal of introns and the splicing together of exons is a fundamental post-transcriptional modification process. This process occurs in the nucleus and is mediated by spliceosomes, which are complexes of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and proteins. The removal of introns and the creation of a continuous coding sequence are critical for the translation of the mRNA into a functional protein.

D. Glycosylation - Glycosylation is a post-translational modification process that involves the attachment of carbohydrate (sugar) molecules to proteins. It does not occur as part of the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. Therefore, this option is the only one that does not accurately describe a post-transcriptional modification of RNA.

A. Ototoxicity - This is a known side effect of Cisplatin. It can cause hearing loss or tinnitus (ringing in the ears) due to its effect on the inner ear's sensory hair cells.

B. Nephrotoxicity - Cisplatin is also known to be nephrotoxic, meaning it can damage the kidneys. This can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

C. Coasting effect - The ""coasting effect"" is a phenomenon where Cisplatin's ototoxic side effects worsen over a period of time after the drug has been discontinued. This is a recognized consequence of Cisplatin use.

D. Pulmonary fibrosis - While certain chemotherapy agents are associated with pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue), Cisplatin is not commonly linked with this side effect. Its primary toxicities are ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and myelosuppression (which can affect the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells).

Given the options, the correct answer is the one that does not typically associate with Cisplatin's side effects.

1064,Memory T cells can be identified by using the following,"['CD 45RA', 'CD45RB', 'CD45RC', 'CD45RO']","To answer this question, let's break down the role of CD45 isoforms and their relationship with memory T cells.

CD45, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is a key receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in the activation and regulation of T cells. It exists in various isoforms due to alternative splicing, which is influenced by the CD45 exon encoding the variable region. Different isoforms are associated with different stages of T-cell development and function.

The correct answer to identifying memory T cells is associated with the CD45RO isoform. Memory T cells are a subset of T cells that have encountered and responded to an antigen before. They have a distinct phenotype that allows them to rapidly respond to future encounters with the same antigen. CD45RO is expressed on the surface of memory T cells.

- CD45RA is typically found on naive T cells, not memory T cells. Naive T cells have not encountered their specific antigen before and thus have not undergone the activation process that leads to the expression of CD45RO.
- CD45RB and CD45RC are less commonly referenced in this context compared to CD45RA and CD45RO. They are associated with different stages of T-cell development or other specific populations of T cells, but not specifically with memory T cells.
- CD45RO is the correct answer as it is the isoform associated with memory T cells.

1074,Keratic precipitates are most commonly seen in -,"['Corneal ulcers', 'Uveitis', 'Nuclear cataracts', 'Keratoconus']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the definition and common associations of Keratic Precipitates (KPs).

Keratic precipitates are small, white or grayish deposits that can be seen on the corneal endothelium. They are often associated with conditions that cause inflammation within the eye, particularly within the anterior chamber. The most common condition associated with the presence of KPs is uveitis, which is characterized by inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye.

Given the options, let's evaluate them in the context of Keratic Precipitates:

- A. Corneal ulcers: While corneal ulcers can be associated with inflammation, the primary manifestation is typically pain, redness, and a visible defect in the corneal surface, rather than KPs.
- B. Uveitis: As mentioned, uveitis is the most common condition associated with KPs due to the inflammation it causes within the eye.
- C. Nuclear cataracts: Cataracts are characterized by the clouding of the lens inside the eye and are not typically associated with KPs.
- D. Keratoconus: Keratoconus is a progressive condition that affects the cornea, causing it to thin and bulge. While it can lead to vision problems, it is not associated with the formation of KPs.

1075,Presenting symptom of nasal myiasis is,"['Severe irritation with sneezing', 'Maggots', 'Nasal pain', 'Impaired olfaction']","To approach this question, let's consider what nasal myiasis is. Nasal myiasis is a condition where fly larvae (maggots) infest the nasal cavity. This can occur due to various reasons such as a wound or an opening in the nasal passage that attracts flies, which then lay their eggs. When the larvae hatch, they can infest the nasal area.

Given the options:

A. Severe irritation with sneezing
B. Maggots
C. Nasal pain
D. Impaired olfaction

Option B directly refers to the maggots themselves, which is not a symptom but rather the cause of the issue. So, option B is not a presenting symptom.

Option C, nasal pain, could be a symptom due to the irritation or infection caused by the maggots, but it's not the most direct or first symptom that would typically prompt medical attention.

Option D, impaired olfaction, refers to a loss of smell, which could be a symptom but is not the most immediate or specific symptom related to nasal myiasis.

Option A, severe irritation with sneezing, is likely the first symptom that would prompt a patient to seek medical attention. The presence of maggots in the nasal cavity would cause severe irritation and sneezing, making it the most appropriate choice for a presenting symptom.

A. Telencephalon - This is the uppermost part of the embryonic brain that will give rise to the cerebral hemispheres (the front and top parts of the brain). The telencephalon is associated with the development of the lateral ventricles, which are located within the cerebral hemispheres.

B. Mesencephalon - This part of the brain develops into the midbrain. The mesencephalon is not directly associated with the development of a ventricle; it is more associated with the development of the oculomotor nerve and the cerebellum.

C. Diencephalon - This is the part of the brain that develops into the thalamus and hypothalamus. It is associated with the development of the third ventricle.

D. Rhombencephalon - This part of the brain develops into the metencephalon and myelencephalon, which eventually give rise to the pons and medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The rhombencephalon is associated with the development of the fourth ventricle, which is located between the cerebellum and the brainstem.

It has a distinctive odontoid process (dens) that projects upward from its body, which is a key anatomical feature.

Among the options, A (IV cervical vertebra) is not the axis. The fourth cervical vertebra (C4) is a normal vertebra in the neck.

Option B (III cervical vertebra) is also incorrect because the third cervical vertebra (C3) does not have the distinctive odontoid process characteristic of the axis.

Option C (II cervical vertebra) is incorrect because the second cervical vertebra (C2) is indeed the axis. This vertebra is uniquely adapted to allow for a wide range of motion in the neck.

Option D (I cervical vertebra) is incorrect because the first cervical vertebra (C1) is known as the atlas, which sits on top of the axis (C2) and allows for rotation of the head.

1086,Insulin stimulated glucose entry in seen in-,"['Cardiac muscles', 'Smooth muscles', 'Brain', 'Intestines']","To answer this question, we need to consider the role of insulin in glucose regulation and its effects on different tissues.

Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas in response to high blood glucose levels. It plays a crucial role in facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, thereby reducing blood glucose levels.

Among the options given, let's examine each tissue's response to insulin:

A. Cardiac muscles: Insulin can increase glucose uptake in cardiac muscles. This is particularly important in cardiac function, as glucose is a vital energy source for heart muscle cells.

B. Smooth muscles: While insulin does have some effect on smooth muscle glucose uptake, its primary role is not in the regulation of smooth muscle glucose metabolism.

C. Brain: The brain has a unique glucose regulation mechanism. It primarily relies on glucose as an energy source, but its glucose uptake is not significantly influenced by insulin. Instead, it uses a separate mechanism involving glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) to maintain a constant glucose supply.

D. Intestines: Insulin does not play a significant role in glucose uptake in the intestines. Instead, the intestines absorb glucose independently of insulin through a sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1).

Considering these facts, the correct answer is the tissue where insulin significantly stimulates glucose entry.

A. Repression: This is a defense mechanism where an individual pushes uncomfortable or painful memories, thoughts, or desires into their unconscious mind, making them inaccessible to conscious awareness. This process effectively excludes painful stimuli from awareness.

B. Reaction formation: This is a defense mechanism where an individual adopts a behavior or attitude that is opposite of their true feelings or desires. This doesn't directly exclude painful stimuli from awareness; it rather transforms or reverses the individual's emotional response.

C. Projection: This defense mechanism involves attributing one's unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to another person. Like reaction formation, it doesn't directly exclude painful stimuli from awareness; it shifts the focus away from the individual's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings.

D. Rationalization: This involves creating logical excuses or explanations for unacceptable behavior or actions. It doesn't exclude painful stimuli from awareness but rather helps justify them.

A. Dilation of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) is often seen in reversible cell injury, as it's a sign of cellular stress and not necessarily indicative of irreversible damage.

B. Dissociation of ribosomes from rough ER is also seen in reversible cell injury. This occurs due to the disruption of protein synthesis and is a common feature of early cellular stress.

D. An intact cell membrane is a hallmark of reversible cell injury. It suggests that the cell is still viable and the injury is not severe enough to cause cell death.

C. Flocculent densities in the mitochondria, on the other hand, are a specific finding that indicates irreversible cell injury. This is a sign of mitochondrial damage and disruption, which is a key indicator of cell death. When the mitochondria are severely damaged, it's often a sign that the cell is no longer viable.

1092,Epinephrine added to a solution of lignocaine for a peripheral nerve block will :,"['Increase risk of convulsions', 'Increase the duration of action of the local anesthetic', 'Both (a) and (b)', 'None of these']","When epinephrine is added to a solution of lignocaine (lidocaine) for a peripheral nerve block, it serves several purposes. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor, which means it causes blood vessels to constrict or narrow. This constriction has several effects:

1. **Decreased absorption**: By reducing blood flow to the area where the local anesthetic is applied, epinephrine decreases the rate at which the anesthetic is absorbed into the bloodstream. This slower absorption rate allows the anesthetic to remain in the nerve for a longer period, which prolongs its effect on the nerve and can increase the duration of the block.
2. **Increased potency**: The slower absorption rate also allows the local anesthetic to achieve higher concentrations in the nerve, making it more effective.

Regarding convulsions, epinephrine itself does not directly increase the risk of convulsions when added to lignocaine for nerve blocks. However, high concentrations of local anesthetics can cause systemic toxicity, which might include neurological symptoms such as seizures or convulsions. The addition of epinephrine can actually help reduce the risk of systemic toxicity by slowing the absorption of the local anesthetic.

Given the options:

- A. Increase risk of convulsions: Incorrect, as epinephrine does not directly increase the risk of convulsions.
- B. Increase the duration of action of the local anesthetic: Correct, due to the vasoconstrictive effects of epinephrine.
- C. Both (a) and (b): Incorrect because option A is not accurate.

1093,Most specific test for organophosphorous poisoning is:,"['RBC cholinesterase level', 'Plasma cholinestrase level', 'RBC uroporphyrin level', 'Measurment of serum level of organophosphorous']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the options and the question.

The question is asking for the most specific test for organophosphorous poisoning. Organophosphorous poisoning is a type of chemical poisoning that can occur from exposure to certain pesticides or nerve agents. The effects of this poisoning are primarily due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. When acetylcholinesterase is inhibited, acetylcholine builds up, leading to overstimulation of muscles and glands, which can cause a variety of symptoms including muscle spasms, paralysis, and even death.

A. RBC (Red Blood Cell) cholinesterase level - This option measures the level of acetylcholinesterase in red blood cells. Since acetylcholinesterase is inhibited in organophosphorous poisoning, measuring its level in RBCs can help diagnose the poisoning.

B. Plasma cholinestrase level - Plasma cholinesterase is another enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, and it is also inhibited in organophosphorous poisoning. However, the level of plasma cholinesterase can also be affected by other factors, making it less specific for diagnosing organophosphorous poisoning.

C. RBC uroporphyrin level - This option is irrelevant to the diagnosis of organophosphorous poisoning. Uroporphyrin is a precursor in the biosynthesis of heme, and its level is not related to organophosphorous poisoning.

D. Measurement of serum level of organophosphorous - While measuring the serum level of the poison itself can indicate exposure, it does not directly measure the effect of the poisoning on the body.

Considering the specificity of the test, measuring the level of an enzyme that is directly affected by the poisoning would be the most specific. Between options A and B, RBC cholinesterase level is considered more specific because plasma cholinesterase levels can be affected by other factors and may not be as reliable for diagnosing organophosphorous poisoning.

1. **CSF Examination Findings:**
   - **Cell count:** 50 cells/HPF with 10 RBCs. The presence of RBCs in the CSF is often an indication of a hemorrhage or a traumatic tap, but in this context, it's more suggestive of an intracranial bleed due to the clinical presentation of convulsions in a newborn.
   - **Protein:** 70 mg/dl. Elevated protein levels in CSF can be seen in various conditions, including bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the context here is crucial.
   - **Sugar:** 30 mg/dl with a blood sugar of 40 mg/dl. The CSF glucose level is typically about two-thirds of the blood glucose level. The significant difference here (30 mg/dl in CSF vs. 40 mg/dl in blood) could suggest a pathological process affecting CSF glucose levels, but in the context of the clinical presentation and the presence of RBCs, it's less likely to be the primary issue.

2. **Clinical Presentation:**
   - **Convulsions in a newborn:** This can be due to various reasons, including metabolic disturbances, infections, or structural brain abnormalities.

Given the options and the analysis of CSF findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A. Meningitis:** While meningitis could present with elevated protein and a low sugar level in CSF, the presence of RBCs and the clinical presentation of convulsions are not the most typical features for meningitis in this age group.

- **B. Intracranial bleed:** This is the most likely diagnosis given the presence of RBCs in the CSF and the clinical presentation of convulsions in a newborn. Intracranial hemorrhage, especially in the context of birth trauma, is a significant concern that could lead to seizures.

- **C. Hypoglycemia:** While the CSF glucose level is low, the blood glucose level is also low, suggesting hypoglycemia rather than an issue specific to CSF. However, the presence of RBCs and convulsions make this less likely as the primary concern.

- **D. None of the above:** Based on the analysis, this is incorrect because one of the options (B) is indeed a likely diagnosis.

1106,Which of the following tests is best for differentiating ACTH secreting pituitary tumour from Ectopic ACTH production?,"['24 hour Urinary free coisol', 'Overnight dexamethasone suppression test', 'Low dose dexamethasone suppression test', 'High dose dexamethasone suppression test']","To differentiate between an ACTH secreting pituitary tumor and ectopic ACTH production, we need to understand how these two conditions respond to different doses of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid.

ACTH secreting pituitary tumors are typically responsive to high doses of dexamethasone because they are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is sensitive to glucocorticoids.

Ectopic ACTH-producing tumors, on the other hand, are not regulated by the HPA axis and are therefore less responsive to glucocorticoids. High doses of dexamethasone do not suppress ACTH secretion from these tumors.

A. Most common cause of chronic infection: HCV is indeed the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, so this statement is true.

B. Has live attenuated vaccine: There is currently no licensed vaccine for HCV, and the development of a vaccine has been challenging. Therefore, this statement is false.

C. Spread by blood transfusion: HCV can be transmitted through blood transfusions, sharing needles, and other routes of exposure to infected blood, so this statement is true.

D. Is a flavivirus: HCV belongs to the family Flaviviridae, which includes other viruses like yellow fever and dengue fever. Therefore, this statement is true.

1109,Which of the following is not a feature of consolidation,"['Increased vocal resonance', 'Dull Percussion note', 'Bronchial Breath sounds', 'Tracheal shift to side of consolidation']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to features of consolidation, which typically occurs in pneumonia or other lung conditions where lung tissue becomes solidified and less air-filled.

A. Increased vocal resonance is often associated with consolidation, as the solidified lung tissue can cause the breath sounds to become louder and more resonant.

B. Dull Percussion note is a classic feature of consolidation. When the lung is consolidated, it becomes denser and sounds dull when tapped with the heel of the hand, unlike the normal resonant sound of a healthy lung.

C. Bronchial Breath sounds are also characteristic of consolidation. The solidified lung tissue causes the breath sounds to become more bronchial, or tube-like, rather than the normal vesicular breath sounds of a healthy lung.

D. Tracheal shift to the side of consolidation is not a feature of consolidation. In fact, a tracheal shift to the side of consolidation is often indicative of a more severe condition, such as a pneumothorax (air in the pleural space) or a large pleural effusion (fluid in the pleural space), where the lung is collapsed on that side. However, in consolidation itself, the trachea is typically not shifted because the lung is still expanded, albeit abnormally.

A. Kaposi's Ca. (Kaposi's Sarcoma) - This is a well-known association with HIV/AIDS. Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels. The virus that causes Kaposi's sarcoma is human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), and its incidence is significantly higher in individuals with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, this is a malignancy associated with HIV.

B. Non Hodgkin's lymphoma - Individuals with HIV/AIDS are at an increased risk of developing Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly the aggressive B-cell lymphomas. The weakened immune system due to HIV makes it difficult for the body to fight off infections, including those that can lead to cancer. Thus, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is also associated with HIV.

C. Astrocytoma - Astrocytomas are a type of brain tumor that originates from astrocytes, a kind of glial cell in the brain. While astrocytomas can be aggressive and malignant, there is no direct, well-documented association between astrocytomas and HIV infection. Astrocytomas are more commonly associated with genetic mutations, radiation exposure, or other risk factors rather than HIV/AIDS.

D. Gastric adeno Ca. (Gastric adenocarcinoma) - Individuals with HIV/AIDS are at an increased risk of various cancers, including gastric adenocarcinoma. The compromised immune system may lead to chronic inflammation and other conditions that increase the risk of developing gastric cancer. Thus, there is an association between gastric adenocarcinoma and HIV.

Given the information above, the correct answer is the malignancy that is least associated with HIV/AIDS.

A. Dreaming - This is more commonly associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, where vivid dreams occur. While some people may dream during SWS, it is less frequent and less intense than in REM sleep.

B. Atonia - This refers to the paralysis of muscles that occurs during REM sleep, not SWS. It's a protective mechanism to prevent acting out dreams.

C. Sleep walking (also known as somnambulism) - This is a phenomenon that occurs during SWS, particularly during the deeper stages. Individuals are in a state of reduced consciousness, and their actions are often performed without memory of them the following morning.

D. Irregular heart rate - This can occur during various stages of sleep and wakefulness. While there can be variations in heart rate during SWS, it is not as specifically associated with this stage as sleep walking is.

A. Production of albumin: The liver produces albumin, which is a protein that carries hormones, vitamins, drugs, and calcium throughout the body. So, this is a function of the liver.

B. Detoxification of ammonia: The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying ammonia, converting it into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys. So, this is a function of the liver.

C. Production of vitamin K: While the liver does play a role in vitamin K metabolism, it is not primarily responsible for its production. Vitamin K is produced by bacteria in the gut, and the liver stores it for later use. However, this option might be a bit tricky, as the liver does metabolize vitamin K, but it's not the primary source of its production.

D. Metabolism of drugs: The liver is responsible for metabolizing drugs, breaking them down into their active or inactive forms, and excreting them from the body. So, this is a function of the liver.

Considering the options, the correct answer is C. Production of vitamin K, as it is not primarily a function of the liver to produce vitamin K, but rather to store and metabolize it.

1123,"A 9-month-old girl is brought with PR bleed, vomiting, mass in right lumbar region with masked liver dullness. She is in shock like condition. Management should include all of the following EXCEPT?","['Barium enema', 'IV fluid', 'Give O2', 'Nasogastric tube']","To approach this question, let's break down the scenario and the options provided.

The patient is a 9-month-old girl presenting with:

1. PR bleed (passage of blood through the rectum)
2. Vomiting
3. A mass in the right lumbar region (suggested by the clinical presentation, possibly a mass in the abdominal cavity)
4. Masked liver dullness (a sign of free air in the abdominal cavity)
5. Shock-like condition

These symptoms are suggestive of an abdominal catastrophe, likely an intussusception, where a part of the intestine telescopes into another segment, causing bowel obstruction, ischemia, and potentially perforation. The masked liver dullness indicates free air in the abdominal cavity, which is consistent with a perforation.

Now, let's evaluate the options for management:

A. **Barium enema** is often used to diagnose and treat intussusception. A barium enema can help reduce the intussusception by injecting air or barium into the bowel to push the telescoped segment back into its normal position. This is a specific treatment for intussusception and is recommended when the diagnosis is confirmed.

B. **IV fluid** administration is appropriate for a patient in shock. Shock, as described, suggests hypovolemia or inadequate circulation, which IV fluid can help to address by expanding the intravascular volume.

C. **Give O2** (oxygen therapy) might be indicated if the patient is experiencing respiratory distress or hypoxemia, which can be a consequence of the shock-like state or the underlying condition causing it.

D. **Nasogastric tube** placement is useful for decompression of the stomach, preventing further vomiting, and reducing the risk of aspiration. It's a supportive measure that can help manage symptoms of vomiting and potential aspiration.

Considering these points, the option that stands out as not being appropriate or necessary in this urgent situation is **A. Barium enema**. While it can be a part of the management of intussusception, it is not the first step when the patient is in shock and there is evidence of a perforation (free air in the abdomen). The immediate priorities should be stabilizing the patient with IV fluids, securing the airway, and preparing for possible surgical intervention to address the perforation.

1125,"H. pylori has been implicated in all, except","['Gastric ulcer', 'Gastric carcinoma', 'Gastric lymphoma', 'GIST']","To answer this question, we need to evaluate the relationship between H. pylori infection and various gastrointestinal conditions.

H. pylori is a bacterium that primarily lives in the stomach lining. It has been strongly linked to several gastrointestinal conditions, including:

* Gastric ulcers (A): H. pylori infection is a major cause of gastric ulcers, which are open sores that develop on the inside lining of the stomach.
* Gastric carcinoma (B): Chronic H. pylori infection is a recognized risk factor for gastric carcinoma, which is a type of stomach cancer.
* Gastric lymphoma (C): H. pylori infection has also been associated with an increased risk of gastric lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune cells in the stomach.

However, GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor) (D) is a rare type of tumor that arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal or their precursors in the digestive tract. While GISTs can occur in the stomach, they are not directly associated with H. pylori infection.

1126,Schistosomiasis is an example of -,"['Meta-zoonoses', 'Cyclo-zoonoses', 'Direct-zoonoses', 'Sporo-zoonoses']","To answer this question, we need to understand the different types of zoonoses.

* Direct-zoonoses (C) involve the direct transmission of a pathogen from an animal to a human, without any intermediate host or vector. Examples include rabies and brucellosis.
* Cyclo-zoonoses (B) involve the transmission of a pathogen between animals through an intermediate host, such as a tick or mite. An example is Lyme disease.
* Sporo-zoonoses (D) involve the transmission of a pathogen through spores. An example is blastomycosis.
* Meta-zoonoses (A) involve the transmission of a pathogen from an animal to an intermediate host, which then infects a human. An example is toxoplasmosis.

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma species. The transmission of schistosomiasis typically occurs through contact with contaminated water, where the intermediate host (a snail) is involved in the life cycle of the parasite. The adult schistosomes then penetrate the human skin, causing infection.

Given this information, schistosomiasis is an example of a meta-zoonosis, because it involves an intermediate host (the snail) between the animal reservoir and the human host.

1127,"Regarding spring catarrh, all of the following are true, except:","['Cobblestone appearance of conjunctiva', 'Common in spring months', 'Limbus conjunctival thickening', 'Sodium cromoglycate is a form of therapy']","To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to spring catarrh, also known as allergic conjunctivitis or vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) when more severe.

A. Cobblestone appearance of conjunctiva - This is a true characteristic of vernal keratoconjunctivitis, a more severe form of allergic conjunctivitis that can occur in spring and summer months. The cobblestone appearance is due to the large lymphoid cells and eosinophils infiltrating the conjunctiva.

B. Common in spring months - This is true. Allergic conjunctivitis, including the more severe VKC, often presents in the spring and summer months due to the increased pollen count and other allergens.

C. Limbus conjunctival thickening - This is a characteristic of vernal keratoconjunctivitis. The condition can lead to the thickening of the conjunctiva around the cornea and the formation of giant papillae, which can lead to discomfort and vision problems if left untreated.

D. Sodium cromoglycate is a form of therapy - This is also true. Sodium cromoglycate (also known as cromolyn sodium) is used as an eye drop to prevent the release of mediators from mast cells, thus reducing the allergic response in the eye. It is a common treatment for allergic conjunctivitis and vernal keratoconjunctivitis.

Given the above explanations, all options A, B, C, and D are true regarding spring catarrh or vernal keratoconjunctivitis. However, the question asks for the option that is ""except"" true. The answer that stands out as not fitting the pattern of the question is A, as the question specifies ""all of the following are true, except,"" and all options are indeed true. However, if we strictly follow the logic that the question seeks an ""except,"" and considering the phrasing might be interpreted as looking for a condition or symptom not typically or directly associated with spring catarrh (which might be a misunderstanding), one might argue about the direct relevance of each option in the context of the question. 

Given the phrasing and the fact that all options can be considered true in the context of spring catarrh or vernal keratoconjunctivitis, the most fitting response to the question as it's worded would technically be challenging without further clarification. However, if we must choose, a more nuanced interpretation based on the typical understanding of what is ""except"" true in a medical context might lean towards A, considering it describes a characteristic more specific to vernal keratoconjunctivitis rather than ""spring catarrh"" broadly, even though all statements are true for vernal keratoconjunctivitis, which can present in spring.

1129,All of the following causes coloured halos except,"['Corneal edema', 'Retinal degeneration', 'Foreign body', 'Steroids']","To approach this question, let's consider the causes of colored halos and how they relate to each option provided:

1. **Corneal edema**: This condition causes the cornea to swell, which can lead to a change in its shape. This alteration in shape can cause light to be refracted (or bent) unevenly as it passes through the cornea, resulting in the perception of colored halos around light sources. So, corneal edema can indeed cause colored halos.

2. **Retinal degeneration**: This condition involves the deterioration of the retina, which can impair vision but is not typically associated with the phenomenon of seeing colored halos around lights. Retinal degeneration usually affects central vision and the ability to see fine details rather than causing the characteristic perception of colored halos.

3. **Foreign body**: If a foreign body (like a piece of glass or a sharp object) enters the eye, it can cause irritation, inflammation, or even damage to the cornea or other parts of the eye. The presence of a foreign body can lead to corneal edema, which, as mentioned, can cause colored halos. So, a foreign body can indirectly lead to colored halos.

4. **Steroids**: Steroids can be used in the treatment of eye conditions, including those that might lead to corneal edema or other conditions that cause colored halos. Steroids themselves are not typically a direct cause of colored halos, but their use might be part of managing conditions that could lead to this symptom.

Based on the above reasoning, the option that stands out as not causing colored halos is **B. Retinal degeneration**, as it is primarily associated with central vision loss rather than the peripheral light perception issues that lead to seeing colored halos.

A. Propanolol: This is a beta-blocker commonly used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders. Some beta-blockers, including propranolol, have been linked to causing or exacerbating depression in some individuals.

B. Oral contraceptives: Hormonal changes associated with oral contraceptives can influence mood. Some women may experience depression or mood swings when taking oral contraceptives, though this is not a universal effect and can vary widely among individuals.

C. Reserpine: This medication is an antipsychotic and antihypertensive drug that has been used to treat high blood pressure and certain psychiatric conditions. However, it is well-documented to cause depression as a side effect.

D. Flupenthixol: This is an antipsychotic medication that is actually used to treat depression in some cases, particularly in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It has a mood-stabilizing effect and can be used to manage depressive episodes.

- **A. Collapse (Atelectasis)**: This would typically show a more irregular, not homogenous, opacity and might not cause significant mediastinal shift unless there's significant volume loss.
- **B. Pleural effusion**: This is a collection of fluid in the space between the lung and chest wall (pleural space). It could cause a homogenous opacity on the X-ray and would indeed push the mediastinum towards the opposite side because it's fluid filling the space. This seems like a strong candidate.
- **C. Pneumothorax**: This is air in the pleural space, which would typically show as a clear, not homogenous, area on the X-ray. It might cause the mediastinum to shift if the pneumothorax is large, but typically, the mediastinum shifts away from the side of the pneumothorax, not towards it.
- **D. Consolidation**: This is a condition where lung tissue becomes solid due to infection or other causes. It could show as a homogenous opacity, but it's less likely to cause significant mediastinal shift unless the consolidation is very large.

Considering the information, the best option is **B. Pleural effusion**, as it aligns with the description of homogenous opacity and significant mediastinal shift.

A. Tachycardia: Halothane can cause a decrease in heart rate, not an increase. It's a vagally mediated effect, typically leading to bradycardia.

B. Hepatitis: Halothane hepatitis is a known, although rare, complication of halothane anesthesia. It's an idiosyncratic reaction that can occur after exposure to halothane.

C. Bronchodilatation: Halothane can cause bronchodilation, making it a good choice for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

D. Uterine relaxation: Halothane can cause uterine relaxation, which is beneficial in certain obstetric situations, such as fetal distress or during cesarean section.

1137,True regarding the rubens valve is,"['Is a non-rebreathing valve', 'Will not allow spontaneous respiration', 'Is a pressure reducing valve', 'May jam in expiratory position']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option regarding the Rubens valve, which is a type of valve used in medical equipment:

A. Is a non-rebreathing valve: This statement is true. The Rubens valve is designed to prevent rebreathing of exhaled gases, making it a non-rebreathing valve. It ensures that the patient does not inhale the same air they exhaled, improving the effectiveness of respiratory therapy.

B. Will not allow spontaneous respiration: This statement is incorrect. The Rubens valve, like many other non-rebreathing valves, can be set up to allow spontaneous respiration or controlled ventilation depending on the setup and the needs of the patient. It is designed to be flexible to accommodate different respiratory needs.

C. Is a pressure reducing valve: This statement is incorrect. While the Rubens valve is used in conjunction with respiratory therapy and can have an impact on air pressure within the respiratory circuit, its primary function is not as a pressure reducing valve. Pressure-reducing valves are specifically designed to reduce the pressure of a gas to a safe level for the patient, which is not the primary function of the Rubens valve.

D. May jam in expiratory position: This statement is not typically associated with the primary function or common issues of the Rubens valve. While any mechanical component can potentially jam under certain conditions, this is not a characteristic typically highlighted or associated with the Rubens valve in the context of its use and function.

Altered mental status is often the earliest manifestation of increased intracranial pressure following a head injury. This is because increased pressure can cause compression of the brain and its surrounding structures, leading to changes in mental status, such as confusion, agitation, or loss of consciousness.

A. Ipsilateral pupillary dilatation is a sign of third nerve compression, which can occur due to increased intracranial pressure, but it is not the earliest manifestation.

B. Contralateral pupillary dilatation is not a typical sign of increased intracranial pressure.

D. Hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body, can occur due to a variety of factors, including stroke or traumatic brain injury, but it is not the earliest manifestation of increased intracranial pressure.

1139,A patient presents with diarrhoea. analysis of stool on wet mount shows mobile protozoa without RBCs and pus cells. The diagnosis is -,"['Balantidium coil', 'Giardiasis', 'Trichomonas hominis', 'Entamoeba histolytica']","To determine the correct diagnosis, let's analyze the given information and the options:

* The patient presents with diarrhea.
* Analysis of stool on wet mount shows mobile protozoa.
* There are no RBCs (red blood cells) and no pus cells.

This information is crucial in narrowing down the possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The presence of mobile protozoa indicates that the causative agent is a protozoan parasite.

Let's examine the options:

A. **Balantidium coli**: This is a protozoan parasite that can cause diarrhea. However, it is relatively rare and often associated with underlying conditions, such as malnutrition or immunocompromised states.

B. **Giardiasis**: This is caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia. Giardiasis is known for causing diarrhea and is often associated with contaminated water or food. On a wet mount, Giardia trophozoites are indeed mobile and appear as flagellated organisms.

C. **Trichomonas hominis**: This option is less likely because Trichomonas hominis is a flagellate protozoan, but it is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in immunocompromised individuals.

D. **Entamoeba histolytica**: This is a protozoan parasite that can cause amoebic dysentery, which is characterized by diarrhea with blood (RBCs) and sometimes pus cells.

Given the information that the patient has diarrhea with mobile protozoa on a wet mount but without RBCs and pus cells, the most likely diagnosis is **B. Giardiasis**. This is because Giardia infections typically present as watery diarrhea without blood or pus, and the trophozoites are mobile on a wet mount.

*   **Location**: Bochdalek hernias are typically found on the left side of the diaphragm, near the posterior aspect. This is because the left side of the diaphragm is less muscular and more prone to defects. Therefore, option A (""Seen on right side"") is incorrect.
*   **Position**: Bochdalek hernias occur in the posterior aspect of the diaphragm, which makes option B (""Anterior position"") incorrect.
*   **Differential diagnosis**: Bochdalek hernias can be mistaken for other conditions, such as pleuropericardial cysts, due to their similar presentation. This makes option C (""Differential diagnosis for pleuropericardial cyst"") a correct statement.

A. Two live vaccines cannot be administered simultaneously: This statement is generally true. Administering two live vaccines at the same time may increase the risk of adverse reactions, such as fever, and can potentially interfere with the immune response to one or both vaccines.

B. Booster doses are not required when live vaccines are administered: This statement can be false. While live vaccines often provide long-lasting immunity, booster doses may still be recommended for certain live vaccines, such as the MMR vaccine, to ensure continued protection against diseases.

C. Single dose gives life long immunity: This statement can be true for some live vaccines, but it depends on the specific vaccine. Some live vaccines, such as the MMR vaccine, require a booster dose after several years to maintain lifelong immunity.

D. Live vaccine contains both major and minor antigens: This statement is generally true. Live vaccines contain the weakened form of the pathogen (virus or bacteria) that causes the disease, which includes both major and minor antigens.

1144,The structure damaged in the given condition is responsible for all except:,"['Taste sensation of ant 2/3rd tongue', 'Lacrimal gland secretion', 'Parotid gland secretion', 'Platysma contraction']","To determine the correct answer, let's first identify the condition and the structure involved. However, the condition is not specified in the question. But we can deduce the answer by analyzing the functions listed:

A. Taste sensation of ant 2/3rd tongue - This is typically associated with the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).
B. Lacrimal gland secretion - This is controlled by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) as well.
C. Parotid gland secretion - This is controlled by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX), but it also involves the facial nerve for the salivary nuclei.
D. Platysma contraction - This is also controlled by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).

Considering the facial nerve controls all the listed functions, if we assume a condition that affects this nerve, the structure damaged would be responsible for all these functions. However, without a specific condition, we must consider a general principle: the facial nerve is responsible for all these functions.

Given the choices and assuming the facial nerve is involved, we'd be looking for an option that does not belong to the facial nerve's functions. However, none of the provided options can be definitively excluded without knowing the condition. But, we know that the facial nerve is the most likely structure involved given the functions listed.

Therefore, without a specific condition and based on the information provided, it's challenging to definitively exclude any option without making an assumption about the condition. However, considering the functions listed are all associated with the facial nerve, we might need additional context to accurately determine the correct answer.

Given the information and usual expectations for such questions, we'd typically look for an option that is not associated with the facial nerve but is included here for a reason (perhaps to be a distractor). Since we can't definitively exclude any option without knowing the condition, and all functions listed are indeed associated with the facial nerve, we must consider what is least likely or what is known to not be associated in this context.

In many cases like this, the question is trying to test the understanding of the involved nerves and their functions. However, the question does not provide a clear-cut answer without assuming the condition.

For the purpose of this exercise and assuming a condition that affects the facial nerve (and based on the given options), we might lean towards:

1145,Loeffler's medium is-,"['Indicator medium', 'Selective medium', 'Enrichment medium', 'Enriched medium']","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the characteristics of Loeffler's medium.

Loeffler's medium is a type of agar plate that is used to culture and isolate Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the bacteria responsible for diphtheria. It is a selective medium because it allows the growth of C. diphtheriae while inhibiting the growth of other bacteria. This is achieved by the addition of sheep blood and antibiotics to the agar.

Given the options:

A. Indicator medium: An indicator medium is used to determine the presence of a specific substance, such as pH or the presence of a particular enzyme. This is not the primary function of Loeffler's medium.

B. Selective medium: A selective medium is designed to allow the growth of certain bacteria while inhibiting the growth of others. Loeffler's medium is a selective medium because it allows the growth of C. diphtheriae while inhibiting the growth of other bacteria.

C. Enrichment medium: An enrichment medium is used to promote the growth of a specific type of bacteria while allowing other bacteria to die off. While Loeffler's medium does promote the growth of C. diphtheriae, it is not typically considered an enrichment medium.

D. Enriched medium: An enriched medium is a type of medium that has been supplemented with additional nutrients to support the growth of fastidious organisms. While Loeffler's medium does contain sheep blood, it is not typically referred to as an enriched medium.

The normal renal blood flow in a healthy adult is approximately 1200-1300 mL/minute per kidney. However, when considering the options provided, we need to think about the total effective renal blood flow for both kidneys.

The average total renal blood flow for both kidneys is roughly 1200-1300 mL/minute for each kidney, so for both kidneys combined, it would be around 2400-2600 mL/minute.

Among the options provided, the closest value to the total effective renal blood flow (2400-2600 mL/minute) for both kidneys is option C, 625 mL/minute for one kidney. However, since we're considering the total effective renal blood flow for both kidneys, we need to adjust our thinking to match the provided options.

Adrenal adenomas are typically benign tumors that can be visualized on CT scans. The characteristic features of adrenal adenomas on CT include:

* Low attenuation (A) due to high fat content within the tumor.
* Homogenous density and well-defined borders (B) due to the encapsulated nature of the tumor.
* Calcification is rare (D) in adrenal adenomas.
* Enhancement characteristics: Adrenal adenomas typically enhance rapidly and homogeneously after contrast administration, but they wash out the contrast quickly (not late). This is in contrast to non-adenomatous lesions, such as metastases or adrenal carcinomas, which may show delayed washout of contrast.

Given these characteristics, option C (""Enhances rapidly, contrast stays in it for a relatively longer time and washes out late"") does not describe the typical behavior of an adrenal adenoma. Adrenal adenomas tend to enhance rapidly and wash out the contrast early, not late.

1159,"A clinical study involves patients diagnosed with carcinoma whose tumor stage is T4N1M1. The patients' survival rate 5 years from the time of diagnosis is less than 50%, regardless of therapy. Which of the following clinical findings is most likely to be characteristic of this group of patients?","['Cachexia', 'Cardiac murmur', 'Icterus', 'Loss of sensation']","To approach this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each option in relation to the given scenario.

1. **Carcinoma with T4N1M1 staging**: This staging indicates a late-stage cancer, specifically:
   - T4: The tumor is of a high grade and has invaded nearby structures, making it more aggressive and challenging to treat.
   - N1: There is evidence of lymph node involvement, which is a common route for cancer to spread.
   - M1: The cancer has metastasized (spread) to distant parts of the body, indicating a stage 4 cancer.

2. **Survival rate less than 50%**: This indicates a very poor prognosis, suggesting that the cancer is highly aggressive and difficult to manage.

3. **Analyzing the options**:
   - **A. Cachexia**: This is a condition characterized by weight loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue, weakness, and loss of appetite in someone who is not actively trying to lose weight. It is commonly associated with advanced cancer, where the body's metabolic processes are disrupted, leading to weight loss despite adequate nutrition.
   - **B. Cardiac murmur**: This is an abnormal sound heard during a heartbeat, typically indicating heart valve issues or other cardiac problems. While heart problems can be a side effect of cancer treatments, they are not directly linked to the cancer's stage or prognosis in this scenario.
   - **C. Icterus**: Also known as jaundice, this is a condition characterized by yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes due to liver problems or high bilirubin levels. While liver involvement can be a part of cancer metastasis, this symptom is not as directly linked to the overall prognosis as cachexia.
   - **D. Loss of sensation**: This could be related to various conditions, including nerve damage from cancer treatment, but it's not as specifically characteristic of advanced cancer with a poor prognosis as cachexia.

Given the advanced stage of cancer (T4N1M1) and the poor survival rate (less than 50% 5 years from diagnosis), the clinical finding most likely to be characteristic of this group of patients is cachexia. Cachexia is a direct consequence of advanced cancer, which disrupts the body's metabolic processes, leading to weight loss and other systemic effects.

1164,"Once the enamel formation is complete, the tooth will erupt after approximately:","['One year', 'Two years', 'Three years', 'Four years']","To determine when a tooth will erupt after enamel formation is complete, we need to understand the process of tooth development. Enamel formation, also known as amelogenesis, is a critical step in tooth development but does not directly dictate the timing of tooth eruption.

The eruption of a tooth is influenced by several factors, including the completion of root formation, the presence of sufficient space in the jaw, and the development of the periodontal ligament. Typically, once a tooth's enamel formation is complete, it will erupt into the oral cavity as the roots of the tooth develop.

The average time for a tooth to erupt after the initial formation of enamel is around 2 years. This duration allows for the completion of root development and the sufficient space for the tooth to erupt without any complications.

AML transformation can occur in various conditions, but the two most well-known associations are:

1. **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)**: MDS is a group of disorders caused by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells. It is a precursor to AML and can transform into AML in some cases.

2. **Aplastic Anemia**: This is a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce blood cells, leading to anemia, infections, and bleeding. In some cases, aplastic anemia can evolve into AML.

Megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is not typically associated with AML transformation in the same way that MDS and aplastic anemia are. It involves issues with platelet production, but it is not a known precursor condition for AML.

Given these considerations, the correct answer involves selecting both MDS (b) and aplastic anemia (a) as conditions where AML transformation is common.

1177,A 43-year-old man suddenly develops odynophagia. Which organism is most likely to be isolated on throat culture?,"['Mononucleosis', 'S. aureus', 'Normal pharyngeal flora', 'Group A streptococci']","To approach this question, let's break down the key information and analyze the options.

1. **Symptom:** Odynophagia, which is difficulty swallowing due to pain.
2. **Age and Gender:** A 43-year-old man.
3. **Options:**
   - **A. Mononucleosis:** This condition, caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, often presents with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. While it can cause pain, it's less commonly associated directly with odynophagia.
   - **B. S. aureus:** This bacterium can cause infections ranging from mild (like skin infections) to severe (like pneumonia or sepsis). However, it's not the most common cause of odynophagia.
   - **C. Normal pharyngeal flora:** Bacteria that are typically found on the body, especially in the throat, can cause infections when they enter tissues or organs. These infections can indeed cause pain and difficulty swallowing.
   - **D. Group A streptococci:** This bacterium is known for causing strep throat, which presents with symptoms like sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. While it can cause pain, the term ""odynophagia"" more specifically suggests a pain upon swallowing, which is a hallmark of conditions like esophagitis.

Given the specific symptom of odynophagia, which is pain on swallowing, the most likely cause among the options provided would be an infection that directly affects the esophagus or pharynx, causing pain upon swallowing. Among the options provided, the best answer would be an organism that commonly causes infections in these areas. Group A streptococci (D) is a common cause of pharyngitis (sore throat), which can be associated with pain, but the description of odynophagia might suggest a more direct involvement of the esophagus than what is typically seen in strep throat.

However, since the question specifically asks about the organism most likely to be isolated on throat culture, and considering the options provided, the most appropriate choice would be an organism that is commonly found in the throat but can cause infection, leading to symptoms like odynophagia. **C. Normal pharyngeal flora** is a broad category that includes bacteria that are typically found in the throat and can cause infections under the right conditions. This option is the most inclusive and thus the most likely to be associated with odynophagia due to the broad range of pathogens that could be involved.

CA 125 is a protein that is often found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. It's a tumor marker, which means that it's a substance that can be found in higher-than-normal amounts in the blood of some people with certain types of cancer. The CA 125 test is used to monitor the effectiveness of ovarian cancer treatment and to detect recurrence of the disease. However, it's not specific to ovarian cancer; elevated levels can also be found in other conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and pregnancy, among others.

A. Ovarian cancer - Correct, as CA 125 is most commonly associated with ovarian cancer.

B. Gall bladder cancer - Incorrect, while gallbladder cancer can cause elevated CA 125 levels, it's not the primary cancer type associated with this marker.

C. Carcinoids - Incorrect, carcinoid tumors are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, and while they can produce various tumor markers, CA 125 is not typically associated with them.

1183,Thermoregulatory response activated by cold is,"['Cutaneous vasodilatation', 'Anorexia', 'Increased voluntary activity', 'Increased respiration']","To answer this question, let's consider the thermoregulatory responses to cold.

When exposed to cold, the body's first response is to try to conserve heat. This is achieved by vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the skin, which reduces blood flow to the surface of the skin and helps to retain heat. However, the question asks about a thermoregulatory response that is activated by cold, not the initial response.

The correct answer should be related to a response that helps to generate heat or increase the body's ability to retain heat.

Option A: Cutaneous vasodilatation is the opposite of what happens in response to cold; it's more associated with heat loss.

Option B: Anorexia (loss of appetite) might be a response to a variety of conditions, but it's not a primary thermoregulatory response to cold.

Option D: Increased respiration, while it might occur due to other reasons in cold conditions (like hypoxia from increased metabolic rate), doesn't directly help in thermoregulation by generating heat.

Option C: Increased voluntary activity would help to generate heat through increased muscle activity. When you're cold, your body might shiver or increase physical activity to generate heat, which is a classic response to cold exposure.

1188,Apoptotic bodies are,"['Clumped chromatin bodies', 'Pyknotic nucleus without organelles', 'Cell membrane bound with organelles', 'No nucleus with organelles']","To answer this question, let's consider what apoptotic bodies are. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, a mechanism by which cells self-destruct in a controlled manner. During apoptosis, the cell undergoes a series of changes, including cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, and finally, the release of apoptotic bodies. These apoptotic bodies are small, membrane-bound vesicles that contain the cytoplasm and organelles of the dying cell. They are formed when the cell breaks apart after the nucleus has been fragmented.

Considering the options given:

A. Clumped chromatin bodies - This describes a feature more closely related to the nuclear changes seen in apoptosis but does not accurately describe apoptotic bodies themselves.

B. Pyknotic nucleus without organelles - This describes a feature of apoptosis, where the nucleus becomes highly condensed and fragmented, but it doesn't accurately describe the composition of apoptotic bodies.

C. Cell membrane bound with organelles - This option correctly describes apoptotic bodies as being membrane-bound and containing organelles, which is in line with the definition of apoptotic bodies.

D. No nucleus with organelles - This option is incorrect because apoptotic bodies do contain organelles, just as they do in the original cell, but they do not contain a nucleus.

Delayed puberty is a condition where the normal process of puberty is significantly delayed, meaning that the individual does not enter puberty within the normal age range. In females, the first signs of puberty, such as breast development (thelarche) and the beginning of menstruation (menarche), are expected to occur between the ages of 8 and 13. The Tanner stages are a widely accepted method for assessing the physical development of children, adolescents, and adults. In females, the Tanner stages for breast development typically begin around age 10-11.

Given the options, we need to determine the age beyond which the absence of secondary sexual characteristics (such as breast development) and the onset of primary amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) would be considered delayed puberty.

Option A (12 years) is too early to be considered delayed, as the onset of puberty (thelarche) is expected to occur around this age in most females.

Option B (14 years) is getting closer to the age where delayed puberty might be considered, but it's still within the normal range for the onset of puberty.

Option C (16 years) is a reasonable cutoff for considering delayed puberty, as it is beyond the expected age for the onset of puberty in most females.

Option D (18 years) is too late to be considered delayed, as it is within the normal range for completing puberty.

All are true except,"['Increased megakaryocytes in bone narrow', 'Bleeding into the joints', 'Decreased platelet in blood', 'Disease resolves itself in 80% of Patients in 2-6']","Based on the symptoms described, I would reason that the patient is likely experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by a low platelet count. This condition can lead to petechiae and ecchymosis due to easy bruising. Hepato-splenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen) is often present in cases of thrombocytopenia, but in this case, it is specifically mentioned that there is no hepato-splenomegaly.

Option A, ""Increased megakaryocytes in bone marrow,"" is a hallmark of thrombocytopenia, as the body attempts to compensate for the low platelet count by producing more megakaryocytes, which are the cells responsible for producing platelets.

Option B, ""Bleeding into the joints,"" is also a possibility in cases of thrombocytopenia, particularly if the platelet count is very low.

Option C, ""Decreased platelet in blood,"" is consistent with the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.

Option D, ""Disease resolves itself in 80% of Patients in 2-6"", is likely referring to the condition of thrombocytopenia, as it is often self-limiting and resolves spontaneously in a significant percentage of cases.

However, given that the question states ""All are true except"", I must choose an option that is not true. Hepato-splenomegaly is often present in thrombocytopenia, so the statement that there is ""no hepato-splenomegaly"" suggests that the patient may not have thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the correct answer is A, as increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow is a feature of thrombocytopenia, which is not present in this case.

The ""spider leg"" appearance is due to the dilated, cystic spaces that compress and distort the surrounding renal parenchyma and calyces, giving the kidney a characteristic, irregular, and elongated shape, resembling spider legs on the X-ray image.

Given the options:
A. Polycystic kidney - This is the correct answer because the bilateral spider leg sign is a hallmark imaging feature of polycystic kidney disease.
B. Hydronephrosis - This condition involves the dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to obstruction, which is not typically associated with a spider leg appearance.

1194,A 62 year old man has a 25 year history of alcoholism and liver disease. He visits his physician complaining of pain and swelling of his legs. A decrease in which of the following is the most likely cause of the peripheral edema?,"['Capillary hydrostatic pressure', 'Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure', 'Interstitial hydrostatic pressure', 'Plasma colloid osmotic pressure']","To approach this question, let's consider the patient's condition and how it relates to the options provided.

The patient has a 25-year history of alcoholism and liver disease. Chronic liver disease can lead to cirrhosis, which impairs liver function and affects the production of proteins, including albumin. Albumin is a key protein that helps to regulate the balance of fluids in the body by maintaining the plasma colloid osmotic pressure.

Peripheral edema, or swelling of the legs, is often caused by an imbalance in this fluid balance. When the plasma colloid osmotic pressure decreases, fluid can leak out of the blood vessels and into the interstitial space, leading to edema.

Considering the options:

A. Capillary hydrostatic pressure: This is the pressure exerted by the blood within the capillaries. While it can contribute to fluid movement into the interstitial space, it's not directly related to the patient's liver disease.

B. Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure: This refers to the pressure exerted by proteins and other solutes in the interstitial fluid. While it plays a role in fluid balance, it's not directly affected by liver disease.

C. Interstitial hydrostatic pressure: This is the pressure exerted by the fluid within the interstitial space. It can contribute to fluid movement, but it's not directly related to the patient's liver disease.

D. Plasma colloid osmotic pressure: This is the pressure exerted by proteins and other solutes in the plasma. Albumin, a protein produced by the liver, is a major contributor to this pressure. Chronic liver disease can lead to decreased albumin production, resulting in decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure.

Given the patient's history of liver disease, the most likely cause of the peripheral edema is a decrease in the plasma colloid osmotic pressure, due to decreased albumin production.

Assuming the condition is a keloid, which is a type of raised, thick scarring that can grow much larger than the original wound, let's look at the options:

A. Intra-keloidal injection of triamcinolone: This involves injecting a steroid directly into the keloid to reduce its size and inflammation. It's a common treatment for keloids.

B. Wide excision and grafting: This involves surgically removing the keloid and replacing the area with skin grafts. It's a more invasive method used for keloids that are large and disfiguring.

C. Wide excision and suturing: This option is similar to B but doesn't mention grafting. It's a method for removing the keloid surgically, but it doesn't address the need for skin replacement if the excised area is too large to be closed directly.

D. Deep X-ray therapy: This involves using radiation to treat the keloid. It's not a first-line treatment due to potential risks such as cancer induction and the fact that it can cause more harm than good for some patients.

1. **Vasodilation (A)**: The initial step in acute inflammation is the dilation of blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow into the affected area. This leads to increased heat and redness, which are common symptoms of inflammation.

2. **Exudation (B)**: Following vasodilation, the increased blood flow and permeability of the blood vessels cause fluid, white blood cells, and proteins to leak out of the vessels into the interstitial space. This process is known as exudation, contributing to swelling and further symptoms of inflammation.

3. **Neutrophilic response (C)**: Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that are among the first responders to an area of infection or injury. Their rapid migration into the affected tissue is a key component of acute inflammation, helping to combat infections or clean up debris.

4. **Granuloma formation (D)**: Granulomas are collections of immune cells, primarily macrophages, that form in response to chronic inflammation or infection. They are not typically a component of acute inflammation, which is characterized by a rapid and short-term response to injury or infection.

Considering these points, the process that does not fit with the others in the context of acute inflammation is granuloma formation. Granulomas are more commonly associated with chronic inflammation.

1200,False statement regarding myocardial infarction and depression is:,"['Depression is a risk factor for MI', 'MI is a risk factor for depression', ""SSRI's can be used post MI for treatment of depression"", 'Only cognitive behavioral therapy is used after MI']","Let's analyze the options.

A. Depression is a risk factor for MI: This statement is true. Studies have shown that patients with depression are at increased risk of developing myocardial infarction (MI).

B. MI is a risk factor for depression: This statement is also true. MI can lead to depression in some patients, either due to the physical and emotional stress of the event or due to changes in cardiac function that may affect mood.

C. SSRI's can be used post MI for treatment of depression: This statement is true. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used to treat depression after myocardial infarction. They are generally considered safe to use in patients with cardiovascular disease.

D. Only cognitive behavioral therapy is used after MI: This statement is false. While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective in treating depression after MI, it is not the only treatment option. SSRIs, as mentioned, are also commonly used. Additionally, other forms of psychotherapy, such as interpersonal therapy, may also be used.

1201,Fatty acid synthase complex contain the following enzymes except:,"['Enoyl reductase', 'Ketoacyl reductase', 'Acetyl: CoA carboxylase', 'Dehydratase']","To answer this question, we need to understand the enzymes involved in the fatty acid synthase complex and their functions.

The fatty acid synthase complex is a multi-enzyme complex responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The complex contains the following enzymes:

1. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (not part of the fatty acid synthase complex itself, but required for the first step of fatty acid synthesis, converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA)
2. Ketoacyl synthase (also known as β-ketoacyl synthase)
3. Ketoacyl reductase (also known as β-ketoacyl reductase)
4. Hydroxyacyl dehydratase (also known as dehydratase)
5. Enoyl reductase

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is actually the first enzyme in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, but not part of the fatty acid synthase complex. It is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, which then enters the fatty acid synthase complex.

Therefore, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the enzyme that is not part of the fatty acid synthase complex.

1202,"According to WHO, what is given to prevent PPH by active management of third stage of labour?","['IV PGF2 alpha agonist', 'IM oxytocin', 'IV ergometrine', 'Perrectal prostaglandins']","The correct answer is B. IM oxytocin.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL) is a recommended practice to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The first step in AMTSL is the administration of a uterotonic agent, and IM oxytocin is the recommended agent for this purpose.

IM oxytocin is given to stimulate uterine contractions and help control bleeding after delivery. It is a safe and effective way to reduce the risk of PPH, and it is widely used in obstetric practice.

The other options are not correct because:

* IV PGF2 alpha agonist (A) is not typically used for prevention of PPH in the third stage of labor.
* IV ergometrine (C) can be used to control bleeding in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for prevention of PPH in the third stage of labor.
* Perrectal prostaglandins (D) are not typically used for prevention of PPH in the third stage of labor.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and an increased risk of cancer. 

A. Autosomal dominant: Fanconi anemia is actually an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that a person must inherit two mutated copies of the gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Thus, option A is incorrect.

B. Bone marrow show pancytopenia: This statement is correct. Individuals with Fanconi anemia often experience bone marrow failure, leading to pancytopenia, which is a condition where all three blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) are decreased.

C. Usually aplastic anemia: This statement is also correct. Pancytopenia in Fanconi anemia often leads to a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce new blood cells.

D. It is due to defective DNA repair: This statement is correct. Fanconi anemia is caused by mutations in genes involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks, which are complex DNA damage. Cells with these mutations are more likely to develop cancer and experience bone marrow failure.

1205,Sacrococcygeal teratoma is associated with:,"['Meningocele', 'Cardiac detects', 'Hepatic cysts', 'Cystic adenoid malformation']","Sacrococcygeal teratoma is a type of tumor that occurs at the base of the spine, near the tailbone. It is associated with various congenital anomalies, particularly those involving the spine and the nervous system.

One of the well-documented associations with sacrococcygeal teratoma is the presence of a meningocele, which is a type of neural tube defect where there is a protrusion of the meninges through a defect in the spine.

While cardiac defects (B) can also be associated with various congenital anomalies, they are not as directly linked to sacrococcygeal teratoma as meningocele.

Hepatic cysts (C) and cystic adenoid malformation (D) are not typically associated with sacrococcygeal teratoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, as sacrococcygeal teratoma is associated with meningocele.

1206,Osmotic fragility is increased in ?,"['Sickle cell anaemia', 'Thalassemia', 'Hereditary spherocytosis', 'Chronic lead poisoning']","In this question, we're looking for a condition where red blood cells (RBCs) are more prone to bursting or lysis when exposed to osmotic stress, i.e., increased osmotic fragility.

A. Sickle cell anaemia - This condition involves a defect in the hemoglobin molecule, leading to abnormal RBCs that are prone to sickling under low oxygen conditions. However, it doesn't directly increase osmotic fragility.

B. Thalassemia - Thalassemias are a group of disorders characterized by reduced or absent production of one or more globin chains of hemoglobin. While they do affect RBCs, the primary issue is with hemoglobin production, not osmotic fragility.

C. Hereditary spherocytosis - This condition is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in RBC membrane structure. As a result, affected RBCs are sphere-shaped rather than biconcave disk-shaped, which increases their surface area-to-volume ratio and makes them more prone to osmotic lysis.

D. Chronic lead poisoning - Lead poisoning primarily affects the production of hemoglobin and the RBC membrane, leading to a condition called microcytic hypochromic anemia. However, it doesn't specifically increase osmotic fragility.

Given the above information, the correct answer is the condition that specifically affects the structure and function of the red blood cell membrane, making it more susceptible to osmotic lysis.

'Pink disease' is another name for Acrodynia, a rare condition that causes skin discoloration, pain, and swelling in the hands and feet. It's often associated with exposure to a specific heavy metal.

A. Arsenic: While arsenic is a toxic substance, it's more commonly associated with other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

B. Mercury: Mercury poisoning is known to cause a range of symptoms, including neurological problems, kidney damage, and skin discoloration, which can appear as a pinkish hue on the hands and feet. This is consistent with the description of 'pink disease'.

C. Copper: Copper poisoning is rare and typically causes symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It's not typically associated with skin discoloration.

D. Lead: Lead poisoning can cause a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, constipation, and neurological problems, but it's not typically associated with skin discoloration.

The person is unable to extend their fingers, but can extend their wrist and elbow. This suggests that the nerve injury is affecting the musculature responsible for finger extension, but not the musculature responsible for wrist and elbow extension.

The radial nerve supplies the extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers (except the extensor carpi radialis brevis, which is supplied by the radial nerve but has a dual innervation pattern). The posterior interosseous nerve is a branch of the radial nerve that supplies the muscles responsible for finger extension.

The median nerve supplies the muscles responsible for thumb opposition and some finger flexion, but not finger extension.

The ulnar nerve supplies the muscles responsible for finger adduction and some finger flexion, but not finger extension.

Given the options, the nerve injured is most likely the posterior interosseous nerve, which supplies the muscles responsible for finger extension.

A. Exhibitionism: This is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a compulsion to expose one's genitals to an unsuspecting person, often for shock value or to provoke a reaction.

B. Transvestism: Also known as transvestic fetishism, this is a condition where an individual derives sexual pleasure from dressing in the clothes of the opposite sex.

C. Voyeurism: This is the act of deriving sexual pleasure from watching others while they are naked, are engaging in sexual activity, or are in other compromising positions.

D. Eonism: This is an outdated term that was used to describe a condition where an individual identifies with the opposite sex, often through cross-dressing.

Considering the definition of ""mooning"" - which typically refers to the act of exposing one's buttocks to an unsuspecting person - it aligns most closely with exhibitionism, which involves exposing one's genitalia, but can also include exposing other parts of one's body for shock or attention.

1212,The patient with least risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during induction of anesthesia is:-,"['Markedly obese and NPO for eight hours', 'Fed coffee four hours before elective surgery', 'Scheduled for elective cesarean delivery and NPO for 20 hours', 'NPO for four hours after a full meal']","The correct answer is C.

The patient scheduled for elective cesarean delivery and NPO (nil per os, nothing by mouth) for 20 hours has the least risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during induction of anesthesia. This is because the patient has been fasting for a long period of time, reducing the likelihood of gastric contents entering the respiratory tract.

The other options are incorrect because:

A. Markedly obese and NPO for eight hours: Obesity can increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration due to delayed gastric emptying.

B. Fed coffee four hours before elective surgery: Eating and drinking, including coffee, increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration, especially if the patient is NPO for a short period.

D. NPO for four hours after a full meal: Fasting for only four hours after a full meal may not be sufficient to prevent pulmonary aspiration, as gastric emptying can still occur.

A. Fenoldopam - Fenoldopam is a dopamine agonist that has been studied for its potential to protect against contrast-induced nephropathy, but its effectiveness is not well-established. However, it is not commonly recommended as a standard preventive measure.

B. N-acetylcysteine - N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been studied extensively for its potential to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. Some studies suggest it may offer some protection, but its effectiveness is still a topic of debate, and it is often considered a secondary measure.

C. Infusion of Half normal saline - Administering half-normal saline solution (or other types of hydration) before and after contrast media exposure is a widely accepted practice to help prevent contrast nephropathy. It is thought to help dilute the contrast media and reduce its potential to cause kidney damage.

D. Hemodialysis - Hemodialysis is used to treat acute kidney injury or other conditions where the kidneys are not functioning properly. It can be used to remove contrast media from the blood, but it is not a preventive measure. It is used in cases where kidney function is already impaired.

1215,"A multipara with 34 weeks pregnancy tachycardia, fever, hepatospleenomegaly, pallor has :","['Malaria', 'Iron deficiency anaemia', 'Physiological anaemia', 'Megaloblastic anaemia']","Considering the symptoms presented, such as tachycardia, fever, hepatospleenomegaly, and pallor in a multipara at 34 weeks of pregnancy, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that can cause these symptoms, particularly in the context of pregnancy.

Tachycardia (increased heart rate) and fever suggest an infectious process. Hepatospleenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen) is often associated with conditions such as malaria, especially in pregnant women, due to the placental sequestration of infected red blood cells. Pallor indicates anemia, which is common in pregnancy due to increased blood volume and requirements, but the combination with the other symptoms points towards a more severe cause.

Option A (Malaria) is the most fitting diagnosis because it can cause all the symptoms listed: fever, tachycardia, hepatospleenomegaly, and pallor. Malaria is particularly dangerous in pregnancy due to the risk of severe disease and complications such as maternal and fetal anemia, preterm delivery, and low birth weight.

Options B, C, and D are less likely because while they can cause anemia, they do not explain the fever, hepatospleenomegaly, or the severity of symptoms described. Iron deficiency anemia (B) is common in pregnancy but does not typically cause fever or hepatospleenomegaly. Physiological anemia (C) is a mild decrease in hemoglobin levels that occurs in pregnancy due to increased blood volume and does not account for the other symptoms.

1216,Diplopia is usually seen in ?,"['Paralytic squint', 'Non-paralytic squint', 'Both of the above', 'None of the above']","To answer this question, let's break down the concepts involved.

Diplopia refers to double vision, which occurs when the brain receives two different images from each eye. This can be caused by various factors, including misalignment of the eyes (strabismus).

Paralytic squint occurs when there is a muscle paralysis or weakness in one or more of the extraocular muscles, which control eye movement. This can be due to a variety of reasons such as nerve damage, stroke, or other neurological conditions. When a paralytic squint occurs, the affected eye cannot move properly, leading to misalignment of the eyes and consequently causing diplopia.

Non-paralytic squint, on the other hand, is a type of strabismus that is not caused by muscle paralysis. It can be congenital or acquired, and the cause can range from a difference in refractive errors between the two eyes to other factors that affect eye alignment.

Given this information, paralytic squint would more directly lead to diplopia due to the misalignment caused by muscle weakness or paralysis, whereas non-paralytic squint can sometimes be caused by factors that do not directly lead to diplopia.

B. Delayed wound healing - Vitamin C plays a role in collagen synthesis, which is necessary for wound healing. A deficiency in vitamin C can indeed lead to delayed wound healing.

C. Anemia - While scurvy can lead to a decrease in the production of collagen, it can indirectly affect iron absorption and utilization, leading to iron-deficiency anemia. Thus, anemia can be associated with vitamin C deficiency.

D. Infertility - There is no direct, well-established link between vitamin C deficiency and infertility. While a diet rich in fruits and vegetables (which are good sources of vitamin C) is associated with overall health and fertility, infertility itself is not a direct symptom of vitamin C deficiency.

1218,Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for -,"['Proline', 'Lysine', 'Hydroxy lysine', 'Methionine']","To answer this question, we need to understand the role of aminoacyl t-RNA in protein synthesis.

Aminoacyl t-RNA is responsible for delivering amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Each amino acid is linked to its corresponding t-RNA molecule, which is then charged with the amino acid by an aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase.

Now, let's examine the options:

A. Proline - Proline is an amino acid that is normally synthesized in the body from the amino acid glutamate. It is not directly linked to the t-RNA, but rather is synthesized through an intermediate pathway that does not require t-RNA.

B. Lysine - Lysine is an essential amino acid that must be obtained from the diet. It is linked to its corresponding t-RNA molecule and is delivered to the ribosome during protein synthesis.

C. Hydroxylysine - Hydroxylysine is a modified amino acid that is synthesized from lysine in the body. It is not directly linked to its own t-RNA, but rather is synthesized through a post-translational modification of lysine.

D. Methionine - Methionine is an essential amino acid that must be obtained from the diet. It is linked to its corresponding t-RNA molecule and is delivered to the ribosome during protein synthesis.

Based on this information, we can conclude that aminoacyl t-RNA is not required for proline (A), because proline is synthesized through an intermediate pathway that does not require t-RNA.

The velocity of a bullet is a critical factor in determining its destructive power, as it directly affects the kinetic energy released upon impact. The faster a bullet travels, the more energy it possesses, and the greater the damage it can cause upon hitting a target.

Weight, shape, and size of a bullet are also important factors, but they are secondary to velocity in determining destructive power. A heavier bullet may have more kinetic energy, but if it is traveling at a slower speed, it may not be as damaging as a lighter bullet traveling at a higher velocity. Similarly, the shape and size of a bullet can affect its penetration and expansion, but velocity remains the primary factor in determining its destructive power.

Increased osmotic fragility refers to the condition where red blood cells (RBCs) are more prone to bursting (hemolysis) when exposed to a hypotonic solution (a solution with a lower concentration of solutes than the cell). This is often due to changes in the shape or membrane structure of the RBCs.

Let's analyze the options:

A. Hereditary spherocytosis: This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of proteins in the RBC membrane, leading to the formation of sphere-shaped RBCs that are more prone to hemolysis in hypotonic solutions. This condition is characterized by increased osmotic fragility.

B. Sickle cell anemia: This is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin, causing RBCs to take on a sickle shape. While sickle cells are more prone to hemolysis, the primary issue is not increased osmotic fragility.

C. Thalassemia: This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, leading to various forms of anemia. Thalassemia does not typically cause increased osmotic fragility.

D. Iron deficiency anemia: This is a condition where the body does not have enough iron to produce hemoglobin. While it can cause changes in RBC size and shape, it is not typically associated with increased osmotic fragility.

1262,"A three year old child is brought to the emergency depament having just ingested a large overdose of an antihistaminic drug. This drug is a weak base capable of entering most tissues including the brain. On physical examination the hea rate is 100/ minute, blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg and the respiratory rate is 20/ minute. In this case of poisoning:","['Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NH4Cl, an acidifying agent', 'Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NaHCO 3, an alkalinizing agent', 'More of the drug would be ionized at blood pH than at stomach pH', 'Absorption of the drug would be faster from the stomach than from the small intestine.']","To address this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Drug in Question**: The antihistaminic drug mentioned is a weak base. Weak bases are more likely to be ionized in acidic environments and more likely to be in their non-ionized (base) form in alkaline environments. This property is crucial for determining how the drug behaves within the body and how it is excreted.

2. **Ionization State and pH**: 
   - **Stomach pH**: The stomach environment is acidic, with a pH typically around 1.5 to 3.5. In such an environment, a weak base like the antihistaminic drug would be more ionized.
   - **Blood pH**: The pH of blood is slightly alkaline, typically around 7.35 to 7.45. In this environment, the weak base would be less ionized.

3. **Excretion and pH**: For weak bases, the principle of ""ion trapping"" applies in the kidneys. The kidneys filter out the ionized form of the drug (which is more soluble in water and thus more easily excreted) more efficiently than the non-ionized form. To enhance excretion, the urine pH should be made more acidic (acidifying the urine) to keep the drug in its ionized form, making it easier to excrete.

4. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **Option A (Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NH4Cl, an acidifying agent)**: This is correct because making the urine more acidic increases the ionization of weak bases, making them easier to excrete.
   - **Option B (Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NaHCO3, an alkalinizing agent)**: This is incorrect because making the urine more alkaline would increase the non-ionized form of the weak base, which is less soluble in water and thus less easily excreted.
   - **Option C (More of the drug would be ionized at blood pH than at stomach pH)**: This is incorrect because, as explained, the drug would be more ionized at stomach pH (acidic) than at blood pH (slightly alkaline).
   - **Option D (Absorption of the drug would be faster from the stomach than from the small intestine)**: This is incorrect because the drug would be more ionized in the stomach (due to its acidic pH) and less ionized in the small intestine, which has a more neutral pH. Ionized substances are less readily absorbed across cell membranes.

A. Buspirone: Buspirone is an anxiolytic medication that belongs to the azapirone class. It is known for its efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with minimal sedative effects. Buspirone does not have significant anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, or sedative properties, making it an ideal choice for patients who require anxiolytic therapy without excessive sedation.

B. Triazolam: Triazolam is a benzodiazepine with a short half-life, primarily used for treating insomnia. While it has anxiolytic effects, its main indication and use are for inducing sleep rather than managing anxiety. Its sedative effects are significant.

C. Alprazolam: Alprazolam is also a benzodiazepine used for both anxiety disorders and panic disorders. Like other benzodiazepines, it has significant anxiolytic effects but also carries a risk of sedation as a side effect.

D. Chlordiazepoxide: Chlordiazepoxide is a benzodiazepine used primarily for anxiety disorders. It has a range of effects, including anxiolytic, sedative, and muscle relaxant properties. Its use is associated with sedation.

Considering the options, Buspirone (A) stands out for its anxiolytic action with the least sedation, making it the appropriate choice for patients who need anxiolytic therapy without the associated sedative effects.

1272,Baroreceptor stimulation producesa) Decreased heart rate & BPb) Increased heart rate & BPc) Increased cardiac contractilityd) Decreased cardiac contractility,"['b', 'c', 'ac', 'ad']","To answer this question, let's consider how baroreceptors function and their effects on the body.

Baroreceptors are specialized sensors located in the walls of blood vessels, particularly in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses. They detect changes in blood pressure (BP) and stretch in the vessel walls. When blood pressure increases, the baroreceptors are stretched, and this mechanical stimulation sends signals to the brainstem, which then activates the parasympathetic nervous system to counteract the increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when blood pressure falls, the baroreceptors are less stretched, and this decreased stimulation leads to a decrease in parasympathetic activity, allowing the body to increase blood pressure.

The primary goal of baroreceptor stimulation is to maintain homeostasis of blood pressure. The body achieves this through several mechanisms:

1. **Decreased Heart Rate & BP**: When baroreceptors are stimulated (indicating high blood pressure), the parasympathetic nervous system is activated, which leads to a decrease in heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and a subsequent decrease in blood pressure. This is a direct response to high blood pressure to prevent further increase and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.

2. **Increased Heart Rate & BP**: This is not a direct effect of baroreceptor stimulation. Instead, this would be a response to low blood pressure or decreased baroreceptor stimulation, as the body attempts to increase blood pressure.

3. **Increased Cardiac Contractility**: While increased sympathetic activity can lead to increased cardiac contractility (positive inotropic effect), this is not a direct effect of baroreceptor stimulation. Baroreceptor stimulation typically results in a decrease in sympathetic outflow, not an increase.

4. **Decreased Cardiac Contractility**: This would be an effect of parasympathetic activity (like that initiated by baroreceptor stimulation) on the heart, leading to a decrease in heart rate and potentially a decrease in force of contraction as well, although the latter effect is less direct and can be offset by compensatory mechanisms.

Given these considerations, baroreceptor stimulation primarily leads to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure as a response to increased blood pressure. Therefore, the correct answer involves a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure, making option **D. ad** the most appropriate choice.

However, the primary action of the genioglossus (A) is as a lingual protruder, not a depressor. The hyoglossus (B) is a lingual depressor, but it is not the primary muscle in preventing the tongue from falling back.

The palatopharyngeus (C), on the other hand, is part of the pharyngeal constrictors and plays a role in the elevation and retraction of the pharynx. However, its role in preventing the tongue from falling back is minimal.

Given the options, none of the muscles directly described in the choices is primarily responsible for preventing the tongue from falling back after a mandibulectomy. The correct muscle that would be involved in preventing such movement is the styloglossus, which is not listed among the options.

2. **Need for thinness**: This indicates a psychological component where the individual strives for an unrealistic thin physique, often linked to body image issues.

Given these two key points, let's evaluate the options:

- **B. Anorexia Nervosa**: This condition is characterized by a distorted body image and an intense, irrational fear of gaining weight, which leads to restricted food intake and excessive weight loss. It perfectly matches the description provided in the scenario.

- **A. Refeeding Syndrome**: This is a serious condition that can occur in individuals with severe malnutrition when they are reintroduced to food too quickly. It is not directly related to the psychological need for thinness.

- **C. Metabolic Syndrome**: This is a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

1279,Complex polysaccharides are converted to glucose and absorbed by the help of:,"['Na+k+ATPase', 'Sucrase', 'Enterokinase', 'Carboxypeptidase']","To answer this question, we need to identify the enzyme responsible for breaking down complex polysaccharides into glucose, which can then be absorbed.

Complex polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen, are broken down into glucose by enzymes called disaccharidases. One of the primary disaccharidases responsible for this conversion is sucrase, which specifically breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose. However, in the context of complex polysaccharides, the enzyme that plays a crucial role is not specifically listed as sucrase, but rather an enzyme that helps break down disaccharides and oligosaccharides into monosaccharides, including glucose.

Option B, sucrase, is the correct choice because it is one of the enzymes in the small intestine that breaks down disaccharides, including sucrose, maltose, and lactose, into glucose and other simple sugars.

A. It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease: This statement is true. Nizatidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) used to treat peptic ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and other conditions involving excessive stomach acid.

B. It has 100% Bioavailability: This statement is false. Nizatidine has an oral bioavailability of approximately 62%, not 100%. This means that only about 62% of the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream after it is taken orally.

C. It also enhances gastric emptying: This statement is true. In addition to reducing stomach acid, Nizatidine can also speed up gastric emptying. This can help improve symptoms in patients with peptic ulcer disease.

D. It can also lead to tachycardia: While side effects of H2 blockers can include changes in heart rate, tachycardia (rapid heart rate) is not commonly highlighted as a direct effect of Nizatidine. However, it's worth noting that changes in heart rate can be a side effect of many medications, including some H2 blockers, but the primary concern is more often orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing) rather than tachycardia.

1286,Melting temperature of DNA is directly proportional to,"['GC Pairing', 'AT Pairing', 'Length of DNA', 'None of the above']","To answer this question, we need to consider the factors that affect the melting temperature (Tm) of DNA.

The melting temperature is the temperature at which half of the DNA double helix is denatured (i.e., separated into single strands). It is an important concept in molecular biology, as it can be used to assess the stability of DNA double-stranded molecules.

Now, let's consider the options:

A. GC Pairing: DNA double helices with a higher percentage of GC (guanine-cytosine) base pairs have a higher melting temperature. This is because GC base pairs are more stable than AT (adenine-thymine) base pairs due to the presence of three hydrogen bonds between G and C, compared to two hydrogen bonds between A and T.

B. AT Pairing: AT base pairs are less stable than GC base pairs, and therefore, DNA with a higher percentage of AT base pairs will have a lower melting temperature.

C. Length of DNA: While the length of DNA can affect its melting behavior, it does not directly affect the melting temperature in a straightforward manner. The melting temperature is more dependent on the base composition and the sequence of the DNA.

A watershed zone is an area of the body that is particularly vulnerable to ischemia (reduced blood flow) because it is at the boundary between two areas that are supplied by different blood vessels. In the context of the large intestine, the watershed zone is an area that is most susceptible to ischemia due to its relatively poor blood supply.

The rectosigmoid region is known to be a watershed zone because it receives blood supply from both the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, which are two separate blood vessels that supply different parts of the colon.

A. Quinidine: This medication is an anti-arrhythmic that can also increase digoxin levels by reducing its clearance and increasing its reabsorption in the kidneys. Therefore, it can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity.

B. Hydrochlorothiazide: This diuretic can increase digoxin levels by reducing its clearance in the kidneys and also by causing hypokalemia (low potassium levels), which can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity.

D. Furosemide: This loop diuretic can also increase digoxin levels and increase the risk of toxicity by causing hypokalemia and increasing renal clearance of potassium.

C. Triamterene: This potassium-sparing diuretic works differently from the other options listed. It tends to increase potassium levels rather than decreasing them, which can actually decrease the risk of digoxin toxicity.

1291,Orange-skin cornea results due to:,"['Chalcosis', 'Siderosis', 'Ammonia burn', 'Mustard gas']","To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to the condition described, ""orange-skin cornea"".

A. Chalcosis: This refers to a condition caused by the deposition of copper in the body, often as a result of a copper intraocular foreign body. Chalcosis can lead to a range of ocular manifestations, but it's more commonly associated with the Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea, which is a brownish or greenish discoloration around the limbus, rather than an ""orange-skin"" appearance.

B. Siderosis: This condition is similar to chalcosis but results from iron deposition, usually due to an iron intraocular foreign body. It can cause various ocular changes, including the deposition of iron in the cornea, but it's not typically described as causing an ""orange-skin"" appearance.

C. Ammonia burn: Ammonia burns to the eye can cause severe damage, including the formation of a pseudomembrane in the eye, but they are not specifically associated with an ""orange-skin"" appearance.

D. Mustard gas: This is a chemical agent used in chemical warfare. Exposure to mustard gas can cause severe ocular damage, including a condition known as ""vesication,"" which leads to blistering and denudation of the corneal epithelium. The healing process can result in an irregular, scarred appearance of the cornea, which is sometimes described as resembling the texture of orange skin.

Given the characteristics of each condition, the most likely cause of an ""orange-skin"" appearance of the cornea would be exposure to mustard gas.

1293,Mechanism of action of the sulfonylureas is,"['K+ ATP channel blocker', 'Na ATP channel blocker', 'Cl ATP channel blocker', 'Ca ATP channel blocker.']","To answer this question, let's understand how sulfonylureas work.

Sulfonylureas are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. They work by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta cells of the pancreas. The mechanism behind this stimulation involves the closure of potassium (K+) channels in the beta cell membrane, leading to cell depolarization and the opening of calcium (Ca2+) channels. The influx of calcium triggers the release of insulin from the granules in the beta cells.

Given this mechanism, the correct choice is related to the potassium (K+) channels, which sulfonylureas block.

The four rectus muscles (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral) arise from the annulus of Zinn, which is a fibrous ring located at the apex of the orbit. However, the oblique muscles (superior and inferior) have a different origin.

The superior oblique muscle arises from the body of the sphenoid bone, between the optic canal and the superior orbital fissure. It then passes through the trochlea (a pulley-like structure located on the superior medial orbit) before inserting into the superior lateral corner of the eye.

The inferior oblique muscle arises from the anteromedial part of the orbit, specifically from the orbital surface of the maxilla bone, but not from the apex of the orbit.

1299,Which of the following drugs is contraindicated along with spironolactone,"['Chlorothiazide', 'Beta blockers', 'ACE inhibitors', 'Amlodipine']","To solve this question, let's consider the mechanism of action and potential interactions of spironolactone and the given options.

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps the body get rid of excess fluid by increasing urine production but also helps the body retain potassium. Potassium retention can be a problem if a patient is already taking a drug that also causes potassium retention, as this can lead to dangerous levels of potassium in the blood, a condition known as hyperkalemia.

A. Chlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic, which increases the loss of potassium in the urine, making it a compatible combination with spironolactone because it counteracts the potassium-sparing effect.

B. Beta blockers have a variety of effects, but they are not typically associated with significant changes in potassium levels, making them a compatible choice.

C. ACE inhibitors also cause the kidneys to retain potassium by preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which leads to vasodilation and reduced aldosterone levels. The reduction in aldosterone leads to less potassium excretion in the urine, making ACE inhibitors a dangerous combination with spironolactone.

D. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker and does not significantly affect potassium levels, making it a compatible choice.

Given the mechanism of action and potential for increased potassium levels, the combination that is contraindicated with spironolactone is ACE inhibitors.

It represents the multifactorial nature of disease causation, where various risk factors, including environmental, social, economic, and behavioral factors, interact with each other to contribute to the development of a disease. This concept acknowledges that no single factor is solely responsible for causing a disease, but rather the complex interplay of multiple factors.

Given this understanding, the most appropriate statement regarding the web of causation of disease is:

D. Helps to suggest ways to interrupt the risk of transmission

This is because the web of causation highlights the multiple factors contributing to disease development, which can help identify potential points of intervention to prevent or control the disease.

1317,Best prognostic indicator for head injured patients: AIIMS 10,"['GCS', 'CT findings', 'Age of the patient', 'History']","To answer this question, let's evaluate each option as it relates to head injuries and prognostication.

A. GCS: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a neurological scale intended to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. A patient's GCS score can indicate the severity of brain injury, with lower scores indicating more severe injury. It assesses three aspects: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response. The GCS is widely used and recognized for its utility in evaluating the severity of head injuries and predicting outcomes.

B. CT findings: Computed Tomography (CT) scans are crucial in assessing the severity and type of head injury. They can help identify various abnormalities such as fractures, hemorrhages, edema, or herniation, which are indicative of the severity of the injury. However, while CT findings are critical for diagnosis and initial management, they might not directly predict the patient's outcome as accurately as a scoring system like the GCS.

C. Age of the patient: Age is a factor that can influence prognosis and recovery in many medical conditions, including head injuries. However, the age of the patient alone is not a specific prognostic indicator for head injuries. Younger patients, for instance, might have a better prognosis due to resilience and less comorbid disease, but this does not apply universally and can be influenced by many other factors.

D. History: The history of the injury, including the mechanism, duration, and any previous trauma, can provide valuable information. However, in the immediate assessment of a head-injured patient, the history might not always be reliable or available, making it less useful as a prognostic indicator in the acute setting.

Considering the options, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the most direct and widely accepted prognostic indicator for head injured patients. It provides a quantifiable assessment of the patient's neurological status, which has been correlated with outcomes and mortality rates.

The most likely diagnosis is","['Dysgerminoma', 'Endodermal sinus tumor', 'Malignant teratoma', 'Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma']","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the scenario:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 20-year-old female presenting with an ovarian mass. This is a relevant factor, as certain ovarian tumors are more common in younger women.

2. **Size and Characteristics of the Mass**: The mass is 6x6x6cm in size, which is significant. The presence of solid structures within the mass, as identified by ultrasonography, is also crucial. This feature helps to differentiate the mass from purely cystic lesions.

3. **Serum Biomarkers**: The patient's serum levels of AFP (alpha-fetoprotein), β-hCG (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin), and CA 125 are normal. These are commonly elevated in specific ovarian malignancies:
   - AFP is often elevated in yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors).
   - β-hCG is elevated in choriocarcinomas.
   - CA 125 is commonly elevated in epithelial ovarian cancers, such as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.

4. **Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase**: This is a significant finding. Elevated alkaline phosphatase in the context of an ovarian mass is often associated with germ cell tumors, particularly dysgerminoma.

1335,Which cancer is most commonly associated with increased estrogen levels?,"['Cervix', 'Ovarian', 'Breast', 'GTN']","To answer this question, let's consider the relationship between estrogen levels and the development of various cancers.

Estrogen is a hormone that can stimulate the growth of certain tissues in the body. In the case of cancer, high levels of estrogen have been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer.

A. Cervix - While human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-known risk factor for cervical cancer, there is no direct link between estrogen levels and an increased risk of cervical cancer.

B. Ovarian - Ovarian cancer is more commonly associated with genetic mutations (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2) and other risk factors, rather than estrogen levels.

C. Breast - This is the correct answer. Breast cancer is known to be influenced by estrogen levels. Estrogen receptors are found in the cells of some breast cancers, and these cancers tend to grow in response to the presence of estrogen. Therefore, cancers that are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) are more likely to grow and spread in response to high estrogen levels.

D. GTN (Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia) - GTN is a rare type of cancer that occurs in the placenta during pregnancy. While hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect the growth of GTN, there is no direct link between estrogen levels and the development of this cancer.

HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is the first detectable marker of HBV infection and appears in the blood within 2-4 weeks after exposure, making it the earliest indicator of acute HBV infection (Option D).

IgM Anti-HBc (Immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) is also an early marker of acute HBV infection, typically appearing around the same time as HBsAg. It is a more specific marker of acute infection than HBsAg, as it is less likely to be present in individuals with resolved or chronic HBV infection (Option C).

Anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) is typically present in individuals who have been vaccinated against HBV or have recovered from HBV infection. It is not a marker of acute infection (Option B).

IgG Anti-HBc (Immunoglobulin G antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) is a marker of resolved or chronic HBV infection and is not specific to acute infection (Option A).

PAWP is a measurement of the pressure in the left atrium, obtained through a pulmonary artery catheter. It is an indirect measurement of left atrial pressure and can be used to estimate left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in patients with normal left atrial compliance.

LVEDP is the pressure in the left ventricle at the end of diastole, just before the heart starts to contract.

In normal circumstances, PAWP and LVEDP are closely related and usually equilibrate. However, in certain conditions, there can be a gradient between PAWP and LVEDP.

A gradient between PAWP and LVEDP would be seen in conditions that affect the flow or pressure in the left atrium, such as:

- Left atrial myxoma (C): A left atrial myxoma can cause a mechanical obstruction to blood flow in the left atrium, leading to a gradient between PAWP and LVEDP.

Now, let's review the options:

A. Aortic regurgitation: This condition would likely cause an increase in both PAWP and LVEDP, as the regurgitant flow from the aorta back into the left ventricle would increase the volume and pressure in both the left ventricle and left atrium.

B. Constrictive pericarditis: This condition would affect the right ventricle and would not directly impact the gradient between PAWP and LVEDP.

D. Pulmonary thromboembolism: This condition would affect the pulmonary vasculature and would not directly impact the gradient between PAWP and LVEDP.

A. TAPVC (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection): In TAPVC, the pulmonary veins connect to the systemic veins instead of the left atrium. This can lead to a variety of radiographic findings depending on the type of TAPVC, but it's not specifically associated with an ""egg on side"" appearance of the heart.

B. TGA (Transposition of the Great Arteries): In TGA, the aorta arises from the right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. This can lead to an ""egg on side"" or ""egg on end"" appearance of the heart on a chest radiograph, as the great vessels are reversed and the heart is rotated. This option seems correct.

C. ASD (Atrial Septal Defect): In ASD, there is a defect in the interatrial septum, and the heart may appear enlarged or show signs of increased pulmonary vascular markings due to increased flow through the lungs. However, an ""egg on side"" appearance is not typically associated with ASD.

D. VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect): In VSD, there is a defect in the interventricular septum. While a VSD can cause cardiac enlargement and changes in the pulmonary vasculature, it is not specifically associated with an ""egg on side"" appearance of the heart.

Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. This proliferation can lead to various metabolic abnormalities, but the most relevant one related to the options provided is the effect on calcium levels.

In multiple myeloma, the tumor cells can cause the bones to release calcium into the blood, leading to an elevated level of calcium. This condition is known as hypercalcemia. This occurs due to the lytic lesions (bone destruction) caused by the myeloma cells, which releases calcium into the bloodstream.

The other options are not directly related to the typical metabolic abnormalities seen in multiple myeloma:

- Hyponatremia (A) is low sodium levels in the blood, which is not a direct consequence of multiple myeloma.
- Hypokalemia (B) is low potassium levels in the blood, which is also not typically associated with multiple myeloma.
- Hyperphosphatemia (D) is high levels of phosphate in the blood. While hypercalcemia often occurs with hyperphosphatemia due to the kidneys' inability to excrete phosphate when there is high calcium, the primary metabolic abnormality directly associated with multiple myeloma is hypercalcemia.

This pathway is crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting or when glucose is in short supply.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. Alanine - Alanine is a gluconeogenic amino acid. It can be converted into pyruvate, which can then enter the gluconeogenic pathway to form glucose.

B. Serine - While serine can be converted into pyruvate, it is not typically considered a key gluconeogenic amino acid.

C. Valine - Valine is a glucogenic amino acid, meaning it can be converted into pyruvate or acetyl-CoA, which can then be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. However, it is not typically considered a key gluconeogenic amino acid.

D. Tyrosine - Tyrosine is a glucogenic amino acid, but it requires a two-step conversion to form fumarate and acetoacetate, which can then be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. Like valine, it is not typically considered a key gluconeogenic amino acid.

1353,Protrusion of tongue not possible in damage of ?,"['Styloglossus', 'Hyoglossus', 'Palatoglossus', 'Genioglossus']","To answer this question, we need to consider the muscles of the tongue and their functions. The protrusion of the tongue is primarily facilitated by the genioglossus muscle, which is one of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue. This muscle originates from the mental spine of the mandible (lower jawbone) and inserts into the tongue, making it the primary muscle responsible for tongue protrusion.

If the genioglossus muscle is damaged, it would impair the ability to protrude the tongue forward.

Now, looking at the options:
A. Styloglossus - This muscle retracts the tongue and is involved in its elevation and posterior movement. Damage to this muscle would not primarily affect tongue protrusion.
B. Hyoglossus - This muscle depresses and retracts the tongue, also affecting its lateral movement. However, its function is not directly related to tongue protrusion.
C. Palatoglossus - This muscle elevates the tongue, aids in its retraction, and aids in the initiation of swallowing. It does not play a significant role in tongue protrusion.
D. Genioglossus - This is the primary muscle responsible for tongue protrusion, as mentioned.

Therefore, considering the primary function of each muscle, damage to the genioglossus muscle would most significantly impair the ability to protrude the tongue.

1354,A 10-year-old male child with sho stature presented to the pediatric OPD with complaints of frequent headaches over the past 6 months along with slowly progressive loss of vision of the right eye. Lately the child has also staed having trouble in walking along with frequent mood changes and excessive thirst. MRI brain showed a tumour in the sellar region which was resected. HPE examination showed reticular epithelial cells that have appearances reminiscent of the enamel pulp of developing teeth along with calcifications and wet keratin nodules. The gene involved in causing the above condition is also involved in causing which other condition: -,"['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Melanoma', 'Neuroblastoma', 'CML']","To solve this question, we need to identify the condition described and its genetic basis.

The patient's symptoms, including headaches, progressive loss of vision, trouble walking, and mood changes, along with the MRI findings of a tumor in the sellar region, suggest a pituitary tumor. The histopathological examination (HPE) findings of reticular epithelial cells resembling enamel pulp of developing teeth, calcifications, and wet keratin nodules are characteristic of a craniopharyngioma, a type of pituitary tumor that often presents in children.

Craniopharyngiomas are associated with mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, which encodes for the beta-catenin protein. The CTNNB1 gene is also implicated in the development of certain types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma.

Given the scenario, the probable diagnosis is B. Bacillus cereus poisoning.

Here's why:

* Bacillus cereus is a type of bacteria that can produce toxins that cause food poisoning. It is commonly found in foods like meat, poultry, and vegetables, and can also be present in foods like potato salad.
* The symptoms of Bacillus cereus poisoning typically develop within 1-6 hours after eating contaminated food, which fits the timeline in this case (2 hours after the meal).
* The symptoms of Bacillus cereus poisoning can include vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The other options are less likely:

* A. S. aureus poisoning typically has a longer incubation period (6-48 hours) and can cause symptoms like fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, but vomiting is not as common.
* C. Clostridial poisoning (e.g., botulism) typically has a longer incubation period (12-72 hours) and can cause symptoms like muscle weakness, drooping eyelids, and difficulty swallowing, which are not mentioned in this case.
* D. Helicobacter pylori poisoning is not typically associated with food poisoning symptoms like vomiting, but rather with stomach ulcers and chronic gastritis.

1356,Which amino acid migrates fastest on paper chromatography on methylcellulose medium?,"['Aspartic acid', 'Valine', 'Lysine', 'Glycine']","To determine which amino acid migrates fastest on paper chromatography on methylcellulose medium, we need to consider the properties of the amino acids given.

Amino acids have different properties that affect their migration in chromatography. These properties include charge, size, and hydrophobicity. Amino acids with more negative charge and smaller size tend to migrate faster.

Let's examine the options:

A. Aspartic acid: Aspartic acid has a negative charge due to its carboxyl group (-COOH). It also has a relatively small size compared to the other options.

B. Valine: Valine is a nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acid with a relatively large size.

C. Lysine: Lysine has a positive charge due to its amino group (-NH2), making it less likely to migrate faster than negatively charged amino acids.

D. Glycine: Glycine is a small, nonpolar amino acid but has a neutral charge.

Considering the properties of these amino acids, Aspartic acid (A) has a negative charge, which allows it to interact more strongly with the positively charged methylcellulose medium. This interaction would slow its migration. However, Aspartic acid is also relatively small, which would help it move faster. In contrast, Valine (B) has a larger size, which would hinder its migration. Lysine (C) has a positive charge, which would also slow its migration. Glycine (D) has a neutral charge and is relatively small, but its nonpolar nature makes it less likely to interact strongly with the methylcellulose medium, which could affect its migration rate.

However, upon reevaluation, considering the properties of the options, Aspartic acid is not likely to be the fastest due to its negative charge and the nature of the methylcellulose medium. Valine (B) and Glycine (D) are less likely to be the fastest due to their size and nonpolar/hydrophobic nature. Lysine (C) is less likely due to its positive charge. Reconsidering the interaction with the methylcellulose medium, the amino acid that would likely interact least with the medium due to its properties would be Glycine, which would allow it to migrate faster.

1357,The most potent drugs to reduce plasma cholesterol level are:,"['Plant sterols', 'Fibrates', 'Anion exchange resins', 'Statins']","To answer this question, let's evaluate the options:

A. Plant sterols: These are naturally occurring compounds found in plants that can help lower cholesterol levels when consumed as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. While effective, they are not as potent as some other options.

B. Fibrates: Fibrates are a type of lipid-lowering medication that can help lower triglycerides and increase HDL (good) cholesterol. They are effective but generally not considered as potent as statins for reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol.

C. Anion exchange resins: These are another type of lipid-lowering medication that work by binding to bile acids in the gut and removing them from the body, which in turn reduces the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver. While effective, they are not as potent as statins.

D. Statins: Statins are a group of medications that are highly effective at reducing LDL cholesterol levels. They work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is crucial for the production of cholesterol in the liver. Statins are widely recognized as the most potent drugs for lowering cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Considering the potency of each option, statins stand out as the most effective at reducing plasma cholesterol levels.

A. Measles: Chemoprophylaxis is not typically used for measles. Vaccination is the primary prevention method, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may involve administration of immune globulin or a vaccine, but not chemoprophylaxis in the traditional sense used for bacterial infections.

B. Conjunctivitis: While the most common form of conjunctivitis is viral (adenoviral), the bacterial form (e.g., caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis) may require chemoprophylaxis for contacts to prevent the spread. However, the question seems to be asking about chemoprophylaxis that's universally required, and for viral conjunctivitis, chemoprophylaxis is not typically used.

C. Cholera: Cholera is a bacterial infection caused by Vibrio cholerae. Chemoprophylaxis is indeed used for cholera, especially for travelers to endemic areas, to prevent the disease in individuals exposed to the bacteria.

D. Malaria: Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Chemoprophylaxis is commonly used for individuals traveling to areas where malaria is prevalent to prevent infection.

Considering the options, A.

1364,In starvation activities of all of the following enzyme is increased except ?,"['Pyruvate carboxylase', 'Pyruvate kinase', 'PEP carboxykinase', 'Glucose 6 phosphatase']","In starvation, the body's primary goal is to generate energy from stored fat. This process involves the breakdown of fatty acids to produce acetyl-CoA, which is then converted into ketone bodies. However, to convert fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, the body needs to produce ketone bodies from acetyl-CoA, which involves the action of enzymes in the liver.

Pyruvate carboxylase (A) is an enzyme that helps convert pyruvate into oxaloacetate, a key step in gluconeogenesis, which is the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. This process is indeed increased in starvation to provide energy to the brain and other tissues.

PEP carboxykinase (C) is another enzyme in gluconeogenesis, catalyzing the conversion of oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate. Its activity is also increased in starvation for the same reasons.

Glucose 6 phosphatase (D) is the enzyme responsible for the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, converting glucose-6-phosphate into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. Its activity is increased in starvation to provide glucose to the brain and other tissues.

However, Pyruvate kinase (B) is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate. In starvation, glycolysis is actually suppressed, as the body tries to conserve glucose and generate energy from fat instead.

A. Provide nutrition to cancer cells: Glycolysis is indeed a key metabolic pathway that provides energy and nutrients to rapidly dividing cancer cells, even in the presence of oxygen. This is known as the Warburg effect. So, this statement is true.

B. Substrate level phosphorylation at pyruvate kinase: In glycolysis, substrate-level phosphorylation does occur at the step catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, generating one ATP molecule per glucose molecule. This statement is true.

C. Two carbon end product is formed: The end product of glycolysis is pyruvate, which is a three-carbon molecule, not a two-carbon molecule. Therefore, this statement is false.

D. NADPH is formed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is indeed an enzyme in glycolysis that catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, generating NADH (not NADPH) in the process. However, NADPH is primarily generated in the pentose phosphate pathway, not glycolysis. This statement might be misleading but is not directly false in the context of glycolysis alone.

1. **Increasing forgetfulness**: This is a common symptom of various dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia.

2. **Trouble in organizing finances and paying bills**: This indicates a decline in executive function, which is often seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) more prominently than in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

3. **Withdrawn and decreased meeting people**: Social withdrawal can be seen in various dementias, but it's a hallmark feature of frontotemporal dementia, especially the behavioral variant (bvFTD), which is characterized by changes in personality, social behavior, and loss of empathy.

4. **Inappropriate behavior with a female neighbor**: Inappropriate behavior, especially out of character, is suggestive of frontotemporal dementia, particularly the bvFTD variant. This is because FTD is known to affect personality, leading to changes in behavior, including inappropriate social interactions.

5. **Indifference to symptoms**: This is another feature often seen in frontotemporal dementia, where patients may not recognize or acknowledge their own symptoms or problems.

6. **Family history of Alzheimer disease**: While this increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, it's not the only factor, and other forms of dementia can still be considered based on the patient's symptoms.

7. **MMSE score of 23**: A score of 23 indicates mild cognitive impairment. The MMSE is not specific to any type of dementia but can indicate the presence of cognitive decline.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is **D.

1380,Which of following is the feature of Y chromosome?,"['Acrocentric', 'Telocentric', 'Submetacentric', 'Metacentric']","To determine the correct answer, we need to know the characteristics of the Y chromosome.

The Y chromosome is a small chromosome that is found in males and is involved in sex determination. It is known for being acrocentric, which means it has a short arm that is much smaller than the long arm. This is in contrast to the other chromosomes, which are mostly metacentric or submetacentric.

So, considering the options provided:

A. Acrocentric - This is the correct answer, as the Y chromosome is indeed acrocentric.
B. Telocentric - This option is incorrect, as a telocentric chromosome would have no distinct centromere, which is not characteristic of the Y chromosome.
C. Submetacentric - This option is also incorrect, as the Y chromosome is not submetacentric, which would mean it has a distinct centromere but the arms are of roughly equal length.
D. Metacentric - This option is incorrect as well, as the Y chromosome is not metacentric, which would mean it has a centromere that is near the middle of the chromosome, dividing the arms into roughly equal lengths.

The IDC is a standard form used to record the cause of death, which is essential for statistical purposes, research, and tracking disease patterns globally. The IDC is indeed recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for international use, making option D true.

Part I of the IDC is divided into two sections: Part Ia and Part Ib. Part Ia is used to record the immediate cause of death, which is the final disease or condition that led to the patient's death. Part Ib is used to record the underlying cause of death, which is the disease or condition that initiated the chain of events leading to the patient's death. Therefore, option B states that Part I of the certificate deals with the immediate cause and also the underlying cause, which is correct.

Part II of the IDC is used to record other significant conditions contributing to death but not resulting in the underlying cause given in Part I. This is an accurate description of option C.

Option A is the one that is not true. Part I of the IDC deals with both the immediate and underlying causes of death, not just the immediate cause.

1382,"A 44-year-old patient comes to his primary care physician complaining of double vision. On examination, he is unable to adduct or abduct his right eye- On further examination, he is also found to be unable to adduct his left eye. The remainder of the physical examination is normal. 
which of the following is the most likely location of the patient’s lesion?","['Left abducens nerve', 'Left abducens nucleus and left medial longitudinal fasciculus', 'Right abducens nerve', 'Right abducens nucleus and right medial longitudinal fasciculus']","To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the symptoms and the possible locations of the lesion.

The patient has difficulty adducting (moving the eye towards the midline) his right eye and also has difficulty adducting his left eye. The ability to abduct (move the eye away from the midline) is impaired in both eyes, specifically the right eye.

Given the symptoms, we can infer that the problem lies with the pathways controlling eye movement, specifically the abducens nerve and its connections.

The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) is responsible for controlling the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye. The medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) is a bundle of nerve fibers that coordinates eye movements, including adduction. A lesion in the MLF can cause difficulty adducting the eye on the same side as the lesion (because the nerve fibers that control adduction on that side are affected) and also difficulty adducting the eye on the opposite side (because the nerve fibers that control adduction on that side are affected, but the MLF also influences adduction on the opposite side).

Given the options:

A. Left abducens nerve - This would only affect the right eye's ability to abduct, not adduct.

B. Left abducens nucleus and left medial longitudinal fasciculus - A lesion here would affect the left eye's ability to abduct and the right eye's ability to adduct.

C. Right abducens nerve - This would only affect the right eye's ability to abduct.

D. Right abducens nucleus and right medial longitudinal fasciculus - A lesion here would affect the right eye's ability to abduct and the left eye's ability to adduct.

Since the patient has difficulty adducting both eyes, the lesion must be located in a place where it affects the pathways controlling adduction for both eyes. Therefore, option B (Left abducens nucleus and left medial longitudinal fasciculus) is the most likely location of the lesion.

1383,Semicircular canals are stimulated by:,"['Gravity', 'Linear acceleration', 'Rotation', 'Sound']","To answer this question, let's consider the function of the semicircular canals in the inner ear. They are part of the vestibular system, which is responsible for detecting changes in head position and movement. The semicircular canals are specifically designed to detect rotational movements, or changes in angular acceleration.

A. Gravity - This is more related to the function of the otolith organs (utricle and saccule), which detect linear acceleration and changes in head position relative to gravity, not the semicircular canals.

B. Linear acceleration - This is again more related to the function of the otolith organs, as they are sensitive to linear acceleration and changes in head position relative to gravity.

C. Rotation - This is the correct answer. The semicircular canals are filled with a fluid called endolymph and are lined with sensory hair cells that are embedded in a gel-like substance called the cupula. When the head rotates, the fluid in the semicircular canals lags behind, causing the hair cells to bend and send signals to the brain about the direction and speed of the rotation.

D. Sound - The semicircular canals are not involved in the detection of sound; that function is handled by the cochlea, which converts sound vibrations into electrical signals that are interpreted by the brain.

A. Dried leaf extract - This option does not accurately describe asafoetida. Asafoetida is not typically derived from leaves.

B. Exudate from chopped roots - Asafoetida is known to be derived from the resinous sap of the Ferula plant, which is obtained by tapping the stem. This option seems to be the most accurate description of how asafoetida is processed.

C. Pith of stem boiled and dried - While asafoetida does originate from the stem of the Ferula plant, this option inaccurately describes the process of how asafoetida is obtained. The description of boiling and drying the pith does not match the method used for asafoetida production.

D. Dried and hardened paste of fruit - This option does not accurately describe asafoetida. Asafoetida is not derived from fruits.

1385,"Naltrexone is used to maintain abstinence following opioid withdrawal in addicts. It blocks all of the following featues of opioid use, except -","['Euphoriant effects of opioids', 'Craving for opioids', 'Miosis', 'Respiratory depression']","To answer this question, let's analyze the options one by one in relation to how naltrexone works.

Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist, which means it blocks the effects of opioids by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and body. Here's how it affects each of the options:

A. Euphoriant effects of opioids: Naltrexone blocks the euphoriant effects of opioids by preventing the binding of opioids to mu-opioid receptors. This reduces the ""high"" associated with opioid use, which is a significant motivator for addiction.

B. Craving for opioids: While naltrexone doesn't directly block the craving for opioids, the reduction in euphoriant effects can indirectly reduce the desire to use opioids. However, the primary action of naltrexone is not to directly block craving.

C. Miosis: Miosis (pupillary constriction) is a classic symptom of opioid use. Naltrexone blocks the opioid receptors, which can reverse miosis, but this is less commonly the primary concern in addiction treatment.

D. Respiratory depression: Naltrexone blocks the respiratory depressant effects of opioids by preventing the binding of opioids to mu-opioid receptors in the brainstem, which controls breathing. This is a critical effect because opioid overdose can lead to respiratory arrest.

Considering these points, the correct answer is B because naltrexone primarily works by blocking the effects of opioids, including euphoria, respiratory depression, and miosis, but its mechanism does not directly involve blocking the craving for opioids. The craving for opioids is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors, including psychological dependence and withdrawal symptoms, which naltrexone does not directly address.

1386,All of the following are precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease except,"['Hypokalemia', 'Hyponatremia', 'Hypoxia', 'Metabolic acidosis']","To approach this question, let's consider what precipitates hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that occurs in patients with liver dysfunction, particularly cirrhosis. It is caused by the accumulation of toxins that the liver is unable to clear from the blood. Several factors can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy, including:

1. **Hypokalemia (A)**: Low potassium levels can increase the absorption of ammonia from the gastrointestinal tract, leading to higher levels of ammonia in the blood, which is a key toxin contributing to hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, hypokalemia is indeed a precipitating factor.

2. **Hyponatremia (B)**: Low sodium levels in the blood can lead to increased ammonia absorption in the gut, further contributing to the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Thus, hyponatremia is also a precipitating factor.

3. **Hypoxia (C)**: Reduced oxygen supply to tissues can impair liver function, increase the production of ammonia, and contribute to the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, hypoxia is considered a precipitating factor.

4. **Metabolic acidosis (D)**: While metabolic disturbances are common in patients with liver disease, metabolic acidosis is not typically considered a direct precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy. In fact, metabolic alkalosis is more commonly associated with the development of hepatic encephalopathy due to the effects of hypoalbuminemia and the resultant shift of potassium from the blood into the cells, leading to hypokalemia.

The anion gap is a calculated value that represents the difference between the concentrations of major cations and anions in the blood. It's an important diagnostic tool used to identify metabolic acidosis, a condition where the body's pH level becomes too acidic.

Now, let's analyze the options:

B. Ethylene glycol - This is a type of sugar alcohol that can cause metabolic acidosis, increasing the anion gap. So, this is not the correct answer.

C. Methylene glycol - This is actually a metabolite of ethylene glycol, and it also contributes to metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap. This is not the correct answer.

D. Diabetic ketoacidosis - This is a complication of diabetes where the body produces high levels of ketones, leading to metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap. This is not the correct answer.

A. Ureterostomy - This is a surgical procedure where a ureter is diverted to the skin. It's not directly related to metabolic acidosis or an increased anion gap. In fact, it's a surgical procedure that can actually reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and metabolic acidosis.

The patient is a 70-year-old male presenting with fatigue and jaundice without a history of alcohol or liver disease. The liver and spleen are nonpalpable, which suggests that there may not be significant hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The patient has normocytic, normochromic anemia, which can be seen in a variety of conditions, including chronic diseases, malignancies, and hemolytic anemias.

Ascorbic acid is known to enhance iron absorption, particularly for non-heme iron, which is found in plant-based foods and is not bound to a protein (unlike heme iron, found in animal products). Non-heme iron is in the ferric state (Fe3+) and must be reduced to the ferrous state (Fe2+) before it can be absorbed. Ascorbic acid acts as a reducing agent, converting ferric iron to ferrous iron. This process makes the iron more soluble and, therefore, more bioavailable for absorption.

Considering the options:

A. Enhances the absorption of heme iron - This is incorrect because ascorbic acid primarily benefits non-heme iron absorption, not heme iron.

B. Enhances the activity of heme oxygenase - This is incorrect because heme oxygenase is involved in the breakdown of heme, which is not directly related to the mechanism by which ascorbic acid enhances iron absorption.

C. Is a reducing agent, thereby helping to keep iron in the ferrous state - This is correct because it accurately describes the role of ascorbic acid in enhancing iron absorption by converting ferric to ferrous iron.

D. Decreases the production of ferritin by enterocytes - This is incorrect because the relationship between ascorbic acid and ferritin production is not directly related to the mechanism of enhancing iron absorption.

1410,The dose of radiation for point A for early and locally advancing cervical cancer during brachytherapy according to ABS guidelines is:,"['70-75Gy- 75-80Gy', '75-75Gy- 80-85Gy', '80-85Gy- 85-90Gy', '85-90Gy- 90-95Gy']","To answer this question, I need to consider the guidelines set by the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) for treating early and locally advanced cervical cancer with brachytherapy.

For cervical cancer, brachytherapy involves placing a radioactive source close to the tumor to deliver a high dose of radiation. The dose delivered to point A is a critical parameter in this treatment, as it helps to control the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues.

According to the ABS guidelines, the dose of radiation for point A in brachytherapy for cervical cancer is typically tailored based on the stage of the disease. For early-stage cervical cancer, a dose range of 70-75 Gy is commonly used. However, for locally advanced cervical cancer, a higher dose is often required to ensure tumor control. The ABS guidelines recommend a dose range of 75-80 Gy for locally advanced cervical cancer.

Therefore, the correct answer that reflects the ABS guidelines for the dose of radiation for point A during brachytherapy for both early and locally advancing cervical cancer is:

1412,"Powders of dental plaster and dental stone differ
mainly in:","['Solubility', 'Shelf life', 'Chemical formula', 'Particle porosity']","To determine the correct answer, let's examine each option in relation to the properties of dental plaster (also known as plaster of Paris) and dental stone (also known as dental stone or hydrocal).

A. Solubility: Dental plaster is known for its ability to set and harden by reacting with water to form calcium sulfate, a process that can be reversed by dissolving it in water because it is relatively soluble. Dental stone, on the other hand, is less soluble than plaster and is more commonly used for making dental models because it is less prone to dissolving. So, solubility is indeed a significant difference between the two.

B. Shelf life: While shelf life might be influenced by storage conditions and the presence of moisture, it is not a fundamental difference based on the chemical properties of dental plaster and dental stone. Both materials can degrade over time, but their shelf life is not inherently different due to their chemical composition.

C. Chemical formula: Both dental plaster and dental stone are forms of calcium sulfate (CaSO4), with plaster being hemihydrate (CaSO4·½H2O) and stone being dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O). While there are differences in their hydration states, their chemical formula is the same, which is why they are both calcium sulfate.

D. Particle porosity: Particle porosity can be affected by how the powders are processed and mixed, but it is not a fundamental property that distinguishes dental plaster from dental stone based on their primary composition.

Given these considerations, the main difference between dental plaster and dental stone lies in their solubility, which directly influences their uses in dentistry.

1413,Which of the following is/are true of blunt renal trauma?,"['Blunt renal trauma and penetrating renal injuries are managed similarly', 'Blunt renal trauma must be evaluated by contrast studies using either IVP or CT', 'Blunt renal trauma requires exploration only when the patient exhibits hemodynamic instability', 'Any kidney fractured by blunt renal trauma must be explored']","The correct answer is C. Blunt renal trauma requires exploration only when the patient exhibits hemodynamic instability.

In the case of blunt renal trauma, most patients can be managed conservatively, with observation and supportive care. However, in cases where the patient exhibits signs of hemodynamic instability, such as significant bleeding or hypotension, surgical exploration may be necessary to repair any injuries to the kidney.

Options A and D are incorrect because blunt renal trauma and penetrating renal injuries are managed differently. Penetrating injuries, such as those from a gunshot or stab wound, often require more immediate surgical intervention, whereas blunt trauma may be managed more conservatively.

Option B is also incorrect because while imaging studies such as IVP (intravenous pyelogram) or CT (computed tomography) may be used to evaluate blunt renal trauma, they are not always necessary for every patient. The decision to use imaging studies depends on the severity of the injury and the patient's overall clinical condition.

A. Rabies is a viral disease that is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, usually through a bite. It is an example of an anthropozoonosis.

B. Plague is a bacterial disease that is primarily transmitted through the bites of infected fleas, which live on rodents and other small mammals. It is an example of an anthropozoonosis.

C. Anthrax is a bacterial disease that is primarily transmitted through contact with infected animals, such as sheep and goats, or through inhalation of spores. It is an example of an anthropozoonosis.

D. Schistosomiasis, on the other hand, is a parasitic disease that is primarily transmitted through contact with contaminated water, where the parasites are released by infected snails. It is not typically considered an anthropozoonosis, as it is primarily transmitted between humans through water, rather than directly from animals to humans.

1440,What is the mechanism of action of Fluconazole?,"['Inhibits fungal mitosis', 'Inhibits lanosterol 14 demethylase', 'Inhibits squalene epoxidase', 'Inhibit ß1,3 glucan synthase']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options in relation to Fluconazole's mechanism of action.

Fluconazole is an antifungal medication, specifically an azole. Azoles are known to inhibit a particular step in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a critical component of fungal cell membranes. The correct enzyme target for fluconazole is lanosterol 14α-demethylase.

Now, comparing the options:

A. Inhibits fungal mitosis - This is not the primary mechanism of action for fluconazole. Mitosis is the process of cell division, but it's not directly related to how fluconazole works.

B. Inhibits lanosterol 14 demethylase - This is the correct mechanism of action for fluconazole. By inhibiting lanosterol 14α-demethylase, fluconazole prevents the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, leading to cell membrane dysfunction and ultimately, fungal cell death.

C. Inhibits squalene epoxidase - This is the mechanism of action for another antifungal drug, terbinafine. It's not related to fluconazole.

D. Inhibit ß1,3 glucan synthase - This is the mechanism of action for echinocandins, a class of antifungal drugs that inhibit the synthesis of beta-1,3-glucan, a critical structural component of fungal cell walls. It's not related to fluconazole.

1441,Nephrotic range of proteinuria is,"['> 30 mg/m2/hr', '> 40 mg/m2/hr', '> 2 gm/m2/24hrs', '> 4 gm/m2/24hrs']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the options and the definition of nephrotic range proteinuria.

Nephrotic range proteinuria is typically defined as the loss of more than 3.5 grams of protein per day (or approximately 40 mg/m2/hr for a child, but since the options are given in terms of grams per square meter per 24 hours, we can consider the equivalent) through the urine. This is a significant amount of protein loss, indicating kidney damage or disease.

Option A (>30 mg/m2/hr) is close but not the threshold for nephrotic range proteinuria.
Option B (>40 mg/m2/hr) is actually a more appropriate threshold, but it's given in milligrams per square meter per hour, not grams per square meter per 24 hours, which is the standard unit for nephrotic range.
Option C (>2 gm/m2/24hrs) is below the typical threshold for nephrotic range proteinuria.
Option D (>4 gm/m2/24hrs) aligns with the definition of nephrotic range proteinuria when considering the equivalent in grams per square meter per 24 hours.

1444,Chronic lymphoedema of the limb is predisposed to all of the following except -,"['Thickening of the skin', 'Recurrent soft tissue infections', ""Marjolin' s ulcer"", 'Sarcoma']","To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option in relation to chronic lymphoedema of the limb:

A. Thickening of the skin: Chronic lymphoedema can lead to the thickening of the skin, a condition known as lipodermatosclerosis, due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

B. Recurrent soft tissue infections: Individuals with chronic lymphoedema are indeed at a higher risk of developing recurrent soft tissue infections, such as cellulitis, due to the accumulation of protein-rich fluid that provides a favorable environment for bacterial growth.

D. Sarcoma: There is a well-documented association between chronic lymphoedema and the development of lymphangiosarcoma, also known as Stewart-Treves syndrome, a rare and aggressive type of sarcoma that arises from the lymphatic vessels.

C. Marjolin's ulcer: Marjolin's ulcer is a type of squamous cell carcinoma that arises from chronic wounds or scars, typically seen in the context of burns or other forms of chronic trauma. While it's a potential complication of chronic wounds, it is not specifically associated with chronic lymphoedema of the limb.

Therefore, considering the options provided, the correct answer is the condition that is not specifically associated with chronic lymphoedema of the limb.

1445,Why fetal cells continue to divide but terminally differentiated adult cells do not divide -,"['There are many cyclin inhibitors which prevent cell to enter into S phase in adult', 'Phosphatase absent in fetal cells', 'Proteinase is absent in fetus', 'Absence of CD kinase']","To address this question, let's analyze the options in relation to the cell cycle and cell division.

Cell division is primarily regulated by the cell cycle, which consists of four main phases: G1, S, G2, and M. The transition from one phase to the next is controlled by a series of checkpoints that ensure proper completion of each phase before proceeding to the next. Key regulators of the cell cycle include cyclins (which bind to cyclin-dependent kinases, or CDKs, to facilitate progression through the cell cycle) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), which can halt the cell cycle at specific checkpoints.

Terminally differentiated cells are cells that have exited the cell cycle and are no longer capable of dividing. This is often due to the presence of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) that prevent the cell cycle from progressing beyond the G1 phase or halt the cycle at other checkpoints.

Given this background, let's evaluate the options:

A. This option suggests that there are many cyclin inhibitors which prevent cell entry into the S phase in adult cells. This is consistent with the understanding that CKIs play a key role in preventing cell cycle progression and that terminally differentiated cells have mechanisms in place to prevent division, such as the presence of CKIs.

B, C, and D are less directly related to the regulation of the cell cycle and the mechanisms by which cells are prevented from dividing. Phosphatase and proteinase are enzymes involved in various cellular processes, but their absence is not directly related to the inability of adult cells to divide.

Therefore, the most logical answer based on our understanding of cell cycle regulation is:

1447,True about Hematological change in Pregnancy,"['Total blood volume increases 40% by term', 'The hematocrit increases', 'Red cell volume does not increase until 20 weeks', 'Hematocrit increases due to an increased RBC volume relative to plasma volume']","To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to the hematological changes that occur during pregnancy.

A. Total blood volume increases 40% by term - This statement is true. During pregnancy, the total blood volume increases by about 40-50% by the end of the third trimester. This increase is necessary to meet the increased oxygen and nutrient demands of the mother and the fetus.

B. The hematocrit increases - This statement is false. During pregnancy, the hematocrit (the proportion of blood that is red blood cells) actually decreases slightly due to the increase in plasma volume being greater than the increase in red blood cell mass. This decrease in hematocrit can lead to a mild anemia of pregnancy, known as physiologic anemia of pregnancy.

C. Red cell volume does not increase until 20 weeks - This statement is false. Red blood cell volume begins to increase early in pregnancy, by the end of the first trimester, to help meet the increased oxygen demands of the growing fetus.

D. Hematocrit increases due to an increased RBC volume relative to plasma volume - This statement is false. As mentioned earlier, the hematocrit actually decreases during pregnancy due to the plasma volume increasing more than the red blood cell volume, not due to an increase in RBC volume relative to plasma volume.

1448,Mrs A is hesitant about having children because her two sisters had sons who had died from kinky hair disease. Her mother's brother also died of the same condition. What is the mode of inheritance of kinky hair disease which is running in this family?,"['X-linked recessive', 'X-linked dominant', 'Autosomal recessive', 'Autosomal dominant']","To determine the mode of inheritance of kinky hair disease in this family, we need to consider the pattern of inheritance and the fact that it primarily affects males.

Given that the disease affects the sons of Mrs. A's two sisters, and her mother's brother also died from the same condition, we can infer the following:

* The disease is more common and severe in males, which suggests a sex-linked pattern of inheritance.
* Since the disease affects males, but the sisters are carriers, it implies that the responsible gene is located on the X chromosome.
* The fact that the disease is passed down from the maternal uncle (mother's brother) to his nieces (Mrs. A's sisters), and then to their sons, further supports an X-linked pattern of inheritance.

Considering these points, the most likely mode of inheritance of kinky hair disease in this family is X-linked recessive. This is because the gene responsible for the disease is located on the X chromosome and is more likely to be expressed in males, who have only one X chromosome.

1449,Exposure to noise above--causes permanent loss of hearing:,"['85 dB', '90 dB', '100 dB', '160 dB']","To determine the correct answer, I'll evaluate the options based on the general knowledge of noise exposure levels and their effects on hearing.

*   Prolonged exposure to sounds above 85 dB can cause permanent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This is a well-established fact in occupational health and safety guidelines.
*   Exposure to 90 dB is also considered potentially hazardous, but the risk of permanent damage is lower compared to higher decibel levels.
*   Exposure to 100 dB can cause immediate harm, including eardrum damage and potentially permanent hearing loss, but it's not typically associated with permanent loss without prolonged exposure.
*   Exposure to 160 dB is extremely hazardous and can cause immediate and potentially permanent damage to the eardrum and hearing.

1451,The commonest site of surgical uretero-vaginal fistula is:,"['Below infudibulopelvic ligament', 'Below uterine aery in the mackenrodts ligament', 'Vaginal angle', 'Above uterine aery']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the possible locations and their likelihood of being the most common site for a surgical uretero-vaginal fistula.

A uretero-vaginal fistula is an abnormal connection between the ureter and the vagina, often resulting from surgical procedures, such as hysterectomy. The location of the fistula can be influenced by the surgical approach and the anatomy of the patient.

Option A: ""Below infudibulopelvic ligament"" - This area is quite far from the typical surgical sites where a fistula would be more likely to form due to direct surgical trauma or manipulation of the ureters during procedures like hysterectomy.

Option B: ""Below uterine aery in the mackenrodts ligament"" - This option is not a commonly described location for uretero-vaginal fistulas. The Mackenrodt's ligament (also known as the cardinal ligament) is an important anatomical landmark in gynecologic surgery, but it's not typically associated with the most common site for uretero-vaginal fistulas.

Option C: ""Vaginal angle"" - This option does not specify a precise anatomical location, making it less clear and potentially less accurate than options that describe a specific area related to surgical anatomy.

Option D: ""Above uterine aery"" - This is the most plausible answer. Uretero-vaginal fistulas are most commonly associated with the area where the ureter passes close to the uterus and cervix, near the uterine arteries. This is a common site for surgical manipulation and injury during hysterectomies and other gynecologic surgeries.

1. **Hemoglobin (Hb) of 8 gm%**: This indicates anemia, as the normal range for adult hemoglobin is approximately 13.5-17.5 g/dL for men and 12-16 g/dL for women.

2. **WBC count of 2000/mm^3**: This is significantly low. The normal white blood cell (WBC) count range is about 4,500 to 11,000 cells per microliter (µL). A count of 2000/mm^3 suggests severe leukopenia, which can be seen in several conditions, including bone marrow failure syndromes.

3. **Platelet count of 60,000/mm^3**: This is also low. The normal platelet count range is about 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter (µL). A count of 60,000/mm^3 indicates thrombocytopenia, which can also be seen in bone marrow failure conditions.

Considering these laboratory findings together, the likely diagnosis is a condition that affects the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells. Among the options provided:

- **A. Thalassemia** is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin production, leading to anemia. However, it does not typically cause significant decreases in WBC and platelet counts.

- **B. Sickle cell anemia** is another genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin. Like thalassemia, it leads to anemia but does not explain the marked leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

- **C. Aplastic anemia** is a condition characterized by bone marrow failure, which can lead to a lack of production of all blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This matches the patient's laboratory findings.

- **D. Anemia of chronic disease** refers to anemia associated with chronic inflammatory or infectious diseases. It typically presents with normocytic anemia and does not cause the significant reductions in WBC and platelet counts seen in this patient.

1460,Which of the following means of contraception is the best method to achieve Net Reproductive Rate (NRR)=1?,"['IUCD', 'Condoms', 'Vasectomy', 'Oral pills']","To determine the best method of contraception for achieving a Net Reproductive Rate (NRR) of 1, we must first understand what NRR means. NRR is the average number of daughters a woman would have in her lifetime assuming a stable population. An NRR of 1 indicates that a woman, on average, has exactly one daughter, which means the population is neither increasing nor decreasing.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. IUCD (Intrauterine Contraceptive Device): IUCD is a highly effective method of contraception when used correctly. It can prevent pregnancy for many years, but its effectiveness relies on proper insertion, maintenance, and removal by a trained healthcare provider.

B. Condoms: Condoms are a barrier method of contraception that can be used by men or women. They are effective for preventing pregnancy and STIs, but they are not as effective as IUCD or other long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) if used incorrectly or inconsistently.

C. Vasectomy: Vasectomy is a surgical method of male sterilization that prevents sperm from entering the semen. It is a highly effective, long-term form of contraception when performed correctly. Vasectomy is considered a LARC, which is often recommended for couples who have completed their family and want to prevent future pregnancies.

D. Oral pills: Oral pills are a type of hormonal contraception that can be highly effective when taken correctly. However, they require daily adherence and can have side effects, which may lead to inconsistent use.

Considering the goal of achieving an NRR of 1, the method should be highly effective, long-term, and reliable. Between options A and C, vasectomy (C) is the better choice because it is a highly effective method of contraception that is more likely to be used consistently (since it does not require daily or weekly actions).

Effort during normal respiration is primarily driven by the need to expand the lungs and draw air into the lungs.

A. Lung elasticity - This option is a key factor in normal respiration. The lungs have a natural tendency to recoil or collapse, which requires effort to overcome during inspiration. This elasticity is responsible for the elastic work that occurs during breathing.

B. Respiratory air passages - While the air passages (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles) are essential for conducting air to the lungs, they are not directly responsible for the effort required during normal respiration.

C. Alveolar air spaces - The alveoli are where gas exchange occurs, but they are not directly involved in the effort required for normal respiration. 

D. Creating negative pleural pressure - Negative pleural pressure is a result of the effort to breathe, not the cause. During inspiration, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity and decreases intrapleural pressure, creating a negative pressure.

A pyogenic granuloma, also known as a lobular capillary hemangioma, is a type of skin lesion that typically appears as a small, red, raised bump. It is often associated with trauma but can also occur spontaneously. The key pathological features of a pyogenic granuloma include:

1. **Granulation Tissue**: This is the hallmark of pyogenic granulomas. They are essentially overgrowths of granulation tissue, which is a type of newly formed connective tissue that is rich in small blood vessels. This tissue is part of the body's healing response, especially after injury.

2. **Cavernous Hemangioma**: While pyogenic granulomas do involve blood vessels, they are not typically described as cavernous hemangiomas. Cavernous hemangiomas are a type of vascular malformation characterized by large, blood-filled spaces (caverns).

3. **Epitheloid Cells and Giant Cells**: These are more commonly associated with other types of skin lesions, such as granulomatous reactions. They are not characteristic features of pyogenic granulomas.

Pemphigus vulgaris (A) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. The hallmark of pemphigus vulgaris is the presence of autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 proteins, which are involved in cell-to-cell adhesion. There is no granular deposit of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction in pemphigus vulgaris.

Bullous pemphigoid (B) is another autoimmune blistering disease. It is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against components of the basement membrane zone, specifically BP230 and BP180. However, the hallmark of bullous pemphigoid is the linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermoepidermal junction, not granular deposits of IgA.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (C) is a chronic skin condition characterized by intensely itchy blisters. It is associated with gluten sensitivity and the presence of IgA deposits at the dermoepidermal junction. These IgA deposits are granular and can be seen with immunofluorescence.

Pemphigus foliaceus (D) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin. It is similar to pemphigus vulgaris but affects the skin only. The autoantibodies in pemphigus foliaceus are directed against desmoglein 1 proteins, and there is no granular deposit of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction.

A. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, not a potassium channel opener. It works by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, leading to vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure.

B. Minoxidil is a potassium channel opener. It works by opening potassium channels in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, leading to vasodilation. This results in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and an increase in blood flow.

C. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, thereby reducing blood pressure. It does not act as a potassium channel opener.

D. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective beta-blocker. It works by blocking the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on beta-1 receptors in the heart, leading to a decrease in heart rate and contraction force, and consequently, a decrease in blood pressure.

Smokers: 30 out of 50, so the odds are 30:20 (or 1.5:1)
Non-smokers: 10 out of 50, so the odds are 10:40 (or 1:4)

Now, we need to find the odds ratio (OR). The formula for OR is:

OR = (Odds of developing lung cancer in smokers / Odds of not developing lung cancer in smokers) / (Odds of developing lung cancer in non-smokers / Odds of not developing lung cancer in non-smokers)

OR = (1.5 / 0.5) / (1 / 4)
OR = 3 / 0.25
OR = 12

However, the odds ratio is typically expressed as a ratio of the odds of developing lung cancer in smokers to the odds of developing lung cancer in non-smokers. To get this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1/4 (or 0.25):

OR = 12 / 0.25
OR = 48

Then, we take the square root of 48 to get the odds ratio, since we're looking for the ratio of the odds of developing lung cancer in smokers to the odds of developing lung cancer in non-smokers:

OR = √48 ≈ 6.9

Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get approximately 7.

1502,"In emergency tracheostomy all of the following structures are damaged, EXCEPT:","['Isthmus of the thyroid', 'Inferior thyroid aery', 'Thyroid ima aery', 'Inferior thyroid vein']","To answer this question, let's consider the anatomy involved in an emergency tracheostomy and the structures that are typically damaged during the procedure.

Emergency tracheostomy is often performed in situations where there is a need for immediate airway access, such as in cases of severe respiratory distress or trauma. The procedure involves making an incision in the anterior neck to access the trachea.

Given the anatomy, let's consider each option:

A. Isthmus of the thyroid - The isthmus of the thyroid gland lies anterior to the trachea and can be damaged during a tracheostomy. So, this is not the correct answer.

B. Inferior thyroid artery - The inferior thyroid artery typically runs posteriorly to the trachea and is less likely to be damaged during a tracheostomy. This option seems to be the exception.

C. Thyroid ima artery - The thyroid ima artery is a small artery that can supply the anterior part of the thyroid gland. It is often absent or not clearly identifiable, but when present, it can run close to the trachea and may be damaged during a tracheostomy.

D. Inferior thyroid vein - The inferior thyroid veins are located anterior to the trachea and can be damaged during a tracheostomy.

Considering the anatomy and the potential risks during a tracheostomy, the inferior thyroid artery (B) is the least likely to be damaged due to its posterior location relative to the trachea.

1503,Dry skin seen due to excess dosage of datura is due to,"['Vasodilatation', 'Absence of sweating', 'Central action', 'Change in BMR']","To answer this question, let's break down the effects of Datura and its relation to dry skin.

Datura is a plant that contains tropane alkaloids, which can cause various systemic effects when ingested. One of the primary effects of Datura is its anticholinergic action, which means it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in various bodily functions, including sweating.

Given the options:

A. Vasodilatation - This option refers to the dilation of blood vessels, which is not directly related to dry skin caused by Datura.

B. Absence of sweating - This option is relevant because Datura's anticholinergic action can lead to a decrease in sweating. When the body is unable to sweat, it can cause dry skin, as the skin's natural moisturizing process is impaired.

C. Central action - This option refers to the effects of Datura on the central nervous system, which can lead to various symptoms such as hallucinations and confusion. However, it is not directly related to dry skin.

D. Change in BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) - This option is not relevant to dry skin caused by Datura.

1504,Best method to remove confounding is,"['Randomization', 'Restriction', 'Stratified randomization', 'Multivariate analysis']","To answer this question, let's briefly consider what each option is and its relevance to removing confounding in research studies.

A. Randomization: Randomization is a method used to assign participants to different groups (e.g., control vs. treatment) in a study. It helps to reduce bias by distributing both known and unknown confounders evenly across groups. This method is very effective in minimizing confounding, especially when properly implemented.

B. Restriction: Restriction involves selecting participants for a study based on specific criteria (e.g., only those with a certain disease are included). While restriction can help to control for confounding by limiting the variability in a study, it can also introduce other biases and doesn't inherently address confounding in a way that randomization does.

C. Stratified randomization: This is a more advanced method of randomization that takes into account certain characteristics (strata) of the participants, such as age or gender, to ensure that these variables are evenly distributed across groups. While it's a powerful technique for controlling confounding, it is more complex and not as universally effective as simple randomization for all types of confounding.

D. Multivariate analysis: This refers to statistical methods that allow for the adjustment of confounding variables in data analysis. It's a way to account for confounding after the data have been collected, rather than before. While multivariate analysis is crucial for analyzing data and assessing the independent effect of variables, it doesn't remove confounding in the sense of preventing it from occurring in the study design.

Given these descriptions, the best method to remove confounding, which is to prevent it from affecting the study results, is through randomization. Randomization ensures that both known and unknown confounders are distributed evenly across groups, thereby reducing the risk of confounding bias.

Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation and are used in various medical imaging modalities due to their ability to penetrate soft tissue and highlight specific areas of the body.

Fluoroscopy (Option A) uses X-rays, not gamma rays, to produce images in real-time.

CT Scans (Option B) use X-rays as well, rotating around the body to produce detailed cross-sectional images.

1506,Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia are seen in.,"['CRF', 'Pseudobypoparathyoidsm', 'Vit-D deficiency', 'Vit-D deficiency']","To address this question, let's analyze each option in relation to the given medical condition: hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia.

A. CRF (Chronic Renal Failure): In CRF, there is a buildup of phosphates in the blood due to the kidneys' reduced ability to excrete them. This can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which in turn causes the parathyroid glands to release more parathyroid hormone (PTH). Elevated PTH levels can cause the body to release calcium from bones, leading to hypocalcemia. So, CRF can indeed cause hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia.

B. Pseudohypoparathyroidism: This condition is characterized by resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH). It leads to hypocalcemia due to decreased PTH activity but typically does not cause hyperphosphatemia. Instead, there might be a mild elevation of phosphate due to the kidneys' inability to adequately respond to PTH, but it's not a hallmark of this condition.

C. Vit-D deficiency: Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption from the gut. A deficiency in vitamin D can lead to rickets or osteomalacia (softening of bones), which causes hypocalcemia. However, it typically causes hypophosphatemia, not hyperphosphatemia, as the body absorbs less phosphate from the gut due to the reduced vitamin D levels.

D. This option is a duplicate of C, likely an error in the question.

1509,Gas causing global warming but is not a greenhouse gas?,"['CO2', 'SO2', 'CFC', 'Ozone']","To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of greenhouse gases and the impact of different gases on global warming.

Greenhouse gases are gases in Earth's atmosphere that trap heat. These gases allow sunlight to enter the atmosphere but prevent heat from escaping, causing the ""greenhouse effect"" which warms the planet. The main greenhouse gases include:

* Carbon dioxide (CO2)
* Methane (CH4)
* Nitrous oxide (N2O)
* Ozone (O3)
* Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)

Now, let's examine the options:

A. CO2 - This is a well-known greenhouse gas, so it doesn't fit the question.

B. SO2 - Sulfur dioxide is a pollutant that contributes to acid rain and has a cooling effect on the atmosphere by reflecting sunlight, but it is not a greenhouse gas.

C. CFC - Chlorofluorocarbons are greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.

D. Ozone - Ozone in the stratosphere is a greenhouse gas, but it's also a pollutant in the troposphere.

A. Dens in dente: This is a rare anomaly where a tooth has an additional, smaller cusp or a small, usually conical, tooth-like structure within the larger cusp. It's not typically described in terms of a dilated or invaginated appearance.

B. Dilated odontome: This is a type of odontome that is characterized by a large, dilated appearance on radiographs. An odontome is a hamartoma that consists of a mass of tooth tissue. Dilated odontomes are composed of enamel and dentin, but they do not have the structure of a normal tooth.

C. Dens invaginatus: This anomaly is characterized by an invagination or inward folding of the enamel organ during tooth development, creating a pocket or sac within the tooth. This results in a small, sometimes conical, tooth-like structure within a normal-looking tooth. Dens invaginatus can be associated with various complications, including root resorption or cyst formation.

D. Ghost tooth: This term is not commonly used in dental literature and might refer to a tooth that appears translucent or ""ghost-like"" on radiographs, often due to a lack of mineralization. This is a non-specific term and does not describe a recognized dental anomaly.

Given the above descriptions, without seeing the radiograph, it's challenging to definitively choose one of the options. However, based on the description of ""invagination"" or ""inward folding"" which is characteristic of dens invaginatus, and considering the typical appearance of this anomaly, I would lean towards:

1512,Gaucher's disease is inherited as?,"['Autosomal recessive', 'Autosomal dominant', 'X-linked recessive', 'X-linked dominant']","To answer this question, let's consider the characteristics of Gaucher's disease. Gaucher's disease is a genetic disorder that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in various organs, resulting in a range of symptoms including anemia, bleeding, and enlargement of the spleen.

Given the nature of the genetic disorder, we need to consider the mode of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance typically involves a single copy of the mutated gene, leading to expression of the disorder in every generation. X-linked recessive disorders, on the other hand, affect males more frequently than females because males have only one X chromosome. X-linked dominant disorders are less common, and females are usually more severely affected than males.

Considering the above information, Gaucher's disease is caused by mutations in the GBA gene, which is located on chromosome 1, an autosome (not a sex chromosome). Therefore, it does not follow the pattern of X-linked inheritance. Moreover, since individuals must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disorder, it cannot be autosomal dominant.

1514,"All are TRUE about the relation of inguinal canal, EXCEPT:","['Internal oblique forms the roof', 'Inguinal ligament forms the floor', 'Fascia transversalis forms anterior wall', 'Interfoveolar ligament forms lateral two third of anterior wall']","To answer this question, let's review the anatomy of the inguinal canal.

The inguinal canal is a passage in the lower anterior abdominal wall through which the spermatic cord (in males) or the round ligament of the uterus (in females) passes. The boundaries of the inguinal canal are as follows:

- **Anterior wall**: The anterior wall is formed by the aponeuroses of the external oblique muscle (not the internal oblique, which is mentioned in option A), the internal oblique, and the transversus abdominis muscles. This is a key point.
- **Posterior wall**: The fascia transversalis forms the posterior wall of the inguinal canal.
- **Floor (or base)**: The inguinal ligament indeed forms the floor (or base) of the inguinal canal.
- **Lateral part of the anterior wall**: The interfoveolar ligament (also known as the lacunar ligament or Gimbernat's ligament) does contribute to the formation of the lateral part of the anterior wall.

Given the options and the information above:

- **A. Internal oblique forms the roof**: Incorrect. The roof of the inguinal canal is actually formed by the internal oblique and transversus abdominis aponeuroses, but it is not the primary muscle forming the roof. However, the critical error here is saying it forms the roof when the primary roof is actually formed by the aponeurosis of the external oblique (not the internal oblique), but let's review the other options to ensure the most accurate answer.
  
- **B. Inguinal ligament forms the floor**: Correct.
  
- **C. Fascia transversalis forms anterior wall**: Incorrect. The fascia transversalis forms the posterior wall, not the anterior wall.
  
- **D. Interfoveolar ligament forms lateral two third of anterior wall**: Correct.

Considering the options, A is the least accurate statement regarding the anatomy of the inguinal canal. It inaccurately states that the internal oblique forms the roof of the inguinal canal, which is not its primary contribution, and more importantly, misrepresents the formation of the anterior wall.

1515,Lymphoid tissues reach their maximum size:,"['In early childhood', 'During adolescence', 'At pubey', 'At 20 years of age']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the development of lymphoid tissues, also known as lymph nodes and lymphoid organs, which are crucial for the immune system.

Lymphoid tissues start to develop early in life and continue to mature and grow throughout childhood and adolescence. This growth is in response to the need for the immune system to adapt to various pathogens and to the environment.

During early childhood (A), the immune system is still developing, and while lymphoid tissues begin to form, they are not yet at their maximum size. 

Adolescence (B) and puberty (C) are periods of significant growth and development, including for the immune system, but they are not specifically associated with the maximum size of lymphoid tissues.

At 20 years of age (D), the immune system, including lymphoid tissues, is considered mature and is at its peak in terms of its ability to respond to pathogens.

Given the information above, the correct answer is D, as it is the age when the immune system, and thus the lymphoid tissues, are considered to have reached their maximum size and maturity.

Urease is an enzyme that breaks down urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, which helps the bacteria to survive in environments with low pH, such as the stomach or urinary tract. 

A. H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori) is a bacterium that inhabits the stomach lining and is known to produce high levels of urease to counteract the acidic environment of the stomach. This is a key factor in its ability to cause gastric ulcers and other gastrointestinal diseases.

B. P. mirabilis (Proteus mirabilis) is a bacterium commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and urinary tract. It can produce urease, but its levels are generally lower than those produced by H. pylori.

C. K. rhinomatis (Kingella kingae) is a bacterium that can cause infections in various parts of the body, including the respiratory tract and joints. However, it is not typically known for high urease production.

D. Ureaplasma is a genus of bacteria that can cause infections in the urinary tract and other parts of the body. While it can produce urease, the levels are typically lower than those produced by H. pylori.

Prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a given time. It includes both new and existing cases.

Incidence, on the other hand, refers to the number of new cases of a disease that develop in a population over a specific period of time.

If prevalence is very low compared to incidence, it implies that the disease is being quickly cleared from the population, meaning that either the disease is very fatal and those who contract it do not survive long enough to be counted in the prevalence, or the disease is easily curable and those who contract it are quickly cured and removed from the prevalence count.

1537,An upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion involving cranial nerve VII would most likely produce,"['Contralateral weakness of the lower half of the face with sparing of the upper half of the face', 'Decreased gag (pharyngeal) reflex with decreased taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue', 'Hemianesthesia of the face with flaccid paralysis of the muscles of mastication', 'Ipsilateral anosmia with primary amenorrhea in females']","To answer this question, we need to consider the functions and areas of control of cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) and how an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion would affect it.

Cranial nerve VII is responsible for controlling the muscles of facial expression, taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and some functions of the lacrimal gland (tear production) and the submandibular gland. The facial nerve also carries parasympathetic fibers that regulate these functions.

An upper motor neuron lesion involving cranial nerve VII would affect the motor control of the facial muscles, but not the lower motor neuron (LMN) functions controlled by the nerve, such as taste sensation. UMN lesions typically cause contralateral effects due to the decussation of nerve fibers in the medulla oblongata.

Given this information, let's evaluate the options:

A. Contralateral weakness of the lower half of the face with sparing of the upper half of the face: This option is incorrect because UMN lesions typically cause contralateral effects, and the weakness would affect the upper half of the face, not the lower half.

B. Decreased gag (pharyngeal) reflex with decreased taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue: This option is incorrect because the gag reflex is primarily controlled by cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) and taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue is controlled by cranial nerve IX. Additionally, UMN lesions would not affect the LMN functions of cranial nerve VII, such as taste sensation.

C. Hemianesthesia of the face with flaccid paralysis of the muscles of mastication: This option is incorrect because hemianesthesia of the face would involve a loss of sensation on one side of the face, which is not a typical effect of a UMN lesion involving cranial nerve VII. The muscles of mastication are controlled by the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), not cranial nerve VII.

D. Ipsilateral anosmia with primary amenorrhea in females: This option is incorrect because anosmia (loss of smell) is related to the olfactory system and primary amenorrhea is related to reproductive system issues, neither of which is directly related to cranial nerve VII.

However, none of the options A-D directly match the expected effects of a UMN lesion involving cranial nerve VII. A more likely effect would be contralateral weakness of the upper half of the face, as UMN lesions typically cause contralateral effects. Unfortunately, this specific effect is not listed as an option.

1542,NADPH actions in RBC are a/e,"['Produce ATP', 'Stabilizes the membrane', 'Reductive biosynthesis', 'GP6D deficiency causes decreased synthesis of NADPH']","To solve this question, let's analyze each option in relation to NADPH's actions in Red Blood Cells (RBCs):

A. Produce ATP - NADPH is indeed involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. While NADPH itself doesn't directly produce ATP, the pentose phosphate pathway, where NADPH is a product, can indirectly support ATP production through the generation of ribose-5-phosphate, which is necessary for nucleotide synthesis. However, this is more of an indirect benefit. So, while there's a connection, saying NADPH directly ""produces ATP"" might be a bit of a stretch in the context of its primary functions in RBCs.

B. Stabilizes the membrane - NADPH is crucial for maintaining the stability of the RBC membrane by reducing glutathione, which protects the cell from oxidative damage. This is a correct action of NADPH in RBCs.

C. Reductive biosynthesis - NADPH is indeed involved in reductive biosynthesis. It reduces oxidized molecules like glutathione and is involved in various biosynthetic reactions. This is a correct action of NADPH in RBCs.

D. GP6D deficiency causes decreased synthesis of NADPH - G6PD (Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) is an enzyme crucial for the pentose phosphate pathway, which is where NADPH is synthesized. A deficiency in G6PD leads to decreased ability to synthesize NADPH, which in turn increases the cell's susceptibility to oxidative stress. This statement is true.

Considering the primary actions of NADPH in RBCs, option A is the least accurate description of its functions, as NADPH doesn't directly produce ATP. It's more accurate to say that the pentose phosphate pathway, where NADPH is produced, supports the production of ribose-5-phosphate, which in turn supports the generation of ATP indirectly through nucleotide synthesis.

* DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid) scan is a type of nuclear medicine scan that is particularly useful for imaging the renal cortex and assessing the distribution and function of renal tissue. It is often used to identify scarring, malformations, or areas of reduced function in the kidneys.
* DTPA (Diethylene Triamine Penta-Acetic Acid) scan is another nuclear medicine scan that evaluates renal function, particularly glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is more focused on assessing renal function rather than the distribution of renal tissue.
* MAG3 (Mercaptoacetyltriglycine) scan is also a nuclear medicine scan used for evaluating renal function, particularly in patients with impaired renal function. It is similar to DTPA but provides better imaging in patients with poor kidney function.
* 1123 Iodocholesterol scan is used primarily for adrenal gland imaging, particularly in diagnosing Cushing's syndrome.

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the gums and bone supporting the teeth. The most widely accepted etiology of periodontitis is the accumulation of bacteria in the plaque on the teeth, which causes inflammation and infection of the gums. This condition is often exacerbated by local irritating factors such as poor oral hygiene, smoking, and the presence of other local irritants.

Option A, Occlusal trauma, is a condition where excessive force on the teeth, usually due to uneven bite or grinding, can cause damage to the gums and bone supporting the teeth. While occlusal trauma can contribute to periodontal disease, it is not the primary cause.

Option B, Systemic factors, refers to general health conditions that can affect the entire body, such as diabetes, which can increase the risk of periodontitis. However, systemic factors are not the primary cause of periodontitis.

Option D, Hormonal defects, can affect the gums and increase the risk of periodontal disease, especially during pregnancy or puberty. However, hormonal defects are not the primary cause of periodontitis.

Considering these options, the most accurate answer is C, Local irritating factors, as the primary cause of periodontitis is the accumulation of bacteria in the plaque on the teeth, which causes inflammation and infection of the gums, and local irritating factors such as poor oral hygiene, smoking, and other local irritants exacerbate this condition.

1550,Spatial relationship of every atom in a molecule is known as:,"['Conformation', 'Configuration', 'Both of the above', 'None of the above']","To answer this question, we need to understand the terms ""conformation"" and ""configuration"" in the context of molecular structure.

Conformation refers to the specific spatial arrangement of atoms within a molecule. It's a temporary arrangement that can change due to thermal energy or other external factors, such as the movement of atoms within the molecule. Think of it like the different positions a figure skater can assume while performing a routine – each position is a conformation, and the skater can switch between them as they move.

Configuration, on the other hand, refers to the fixed, three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule. It's a more permanent setup that's determined by the molecular structure and the bonds between atoms. Think of it like the fixed pose a statue assumes – it's a specific arrangement that doesn't change.

Given this, the question asks about the spatial relationship of every atom in a molecule, which sounds like a description of configuration. However, configuration typically refers to the arrangement of atoms in a molecule in terms of their absolute configuration (e.g., R or S configuration in a chiral molecule).

So, while the question seems to be asking for a description of configuration, the answer that comes closest to describing the spatial relationship of every atom in a molecule would be ""conformation"" because it can change and still describe the specific spatial arrangement of atoms. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1561,Main action of superior rectus -,"['Extorsion', 'Intorsion', 'Elevation', 'Depression']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the functions of the extraocular muscles, specifically the superior rectus muscle.

The superior rectus muscle is responsible for rotating the eyeball in such a way that the upper pole of the eyeball is moved upward. This is the primary action of this muscle.

A. Extorsion is the rotation of the eyeball so that the upper pole is moved outward, away from the midline of the body. This is not the primary action of the superior rectus muscle.

B. Intorsion is the rotation of the eyeball so that the upper pole is moved inward, toward the midline of the body. This is also not the primary action of the superior rectus muscle.

C. Elevation is the movement of the eyeball upward, which is the primary action of the superior rectus muscle.

D. Depression is the movement of the eyeball downward, which is the opposite action of the superior rectus muscle.

Based on the above, the correct answer is the one that corresponds to the upward movement of the eyeball.

1562,Disulfiram-like reaction is caused by: Kerala 11,"['Acamprostate', 'Metronidazole', 'Tetracycline', 'Digitalis']","To determine the correct answer, let's examine the options provided and their relationship to a disulfiram-like reaction.

Disulfiram is a medication used in the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to ethanol (drinking alcohol). When alcohol is consumed while taking disulfiram, it can cause a range of unpleasant symptoms, including flushing, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations. This reaction is due to the inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of alcohol.

A disulfiram-like reaction can also be caused by other substances that inhibit the same enzyme or interfere with alcohol metabolism. Let's examine the options:

A. Acamprostate - Acamprosate (also known as N-acetyl homotaurine) is used in the treatment of alcohol dependence but is not known for causing a disulfiram-like reaction.

B. Metronidazole - Metronidazole is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal medication known to cause a disulfiram-like reaction when alcohol is consumed. It inhibits the metabolism of alcohol, leading to the same symptoms seen with disulfiram.

C. Tetracycline - Tetracycline is an antibiotic and is not associated with a disulfiram-like reaction.

D. Digitalis - Digitalis (digoxin) is used in the treatment of heart conditions and is not known to cause a disulfiram-like reaction.

Given the above information, the substance that causes a disulfiram-like reaction is Metronidazole.

1563,"The content of base pair A in the DNA is 15%, what could be the amount of G in DNA according to Chargaff's base pair rule?","['15%', '85%', '35%', '70%']","According to Chargaff's base pair rule, in DNA, the amount of G is equal to the amount of C, and the amount of A is equal to the amount of T. Since the amount of A is 15%, the amount of T must also be 15%. 

The total amount of A and G must be equal to the total amount of T and C, since they pair together. Since A = T = 15%, the total amount of A and T is 30%.

Since A + G = T + C, the amount of G must be equal to the amount of C, which must be 30% - 15% = 15%. However, this is not an option. Let's calculate the percentage of G + C. We already know that A + T is 30%, and G + C must equal A + T since they pair together. So, G + C must be 30%. 

The percentage of G is equal to the percentage of C. Therefore, the percentage of G is 30% / 2 = 15% is incorrect, but the percentage of G + C is 30%. 

However, the amount of G is equal to the amount of C, and the percentage of G + C is 30%, but the options are not 30%. We can try another approach.

Since A + T is 30% and A is 15%, T must be 15%. Therefore, the amount of A + T is 30%, and G + C must be 70% since A + G = T + C. 

Since G and C must be equal, the percentage of G is equal to 70% / 2 = 35%.

In the breast, it is a rare tumor that accounts for less than 1% of all breast tumors.

Considering the options:

A. Axillary lymph node dissection is mandatory - This is incorrect because leiomyosarcoma of the breast is often treated with wide local excision or mastectomy, and the role of axillary lymph node dissection is not well established.

B. Well encapsulated - This is correct. Leiomyosarcomas are typically well-circumscribed and may have a pseudocapsule, making them relatively easy to resect surgically.

C. Follow up not required - This is incorrect. Follow-up is recommended for any cancer, including leiomyosarcoma of the breast, to monitor for recurrence or metastasis.

D. Mastectomy is mainstay treatment - This is incorrect. While mastectomy may be an option for leiomyosarcoma of the breast, it is not always necessary. Treatment often depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as other factors.

1566,What percentage of Lente Insulin is amorphous?,"['70%', '30%', '50%', '90%']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the characteristics of Lente Insulin. Lente Insulin is a type of intermediate-acting insulin, and it is a mixture of crystalline (crystalline zinc) and amorphous (soluble) insulin. The amorphous portion is the soluble fraction, which allows for quicker absorption and onset of action.

Given that Lente Insulin is composed of both crystalline and amorphous fractions, we can infer that the amorphous fraction is less than the total, since some of the insulin is in crystalline form.

Among the options, only one is less than 100% and makes sense given the composition of Lente Insulin. A mixture that is predominantly crystalline, with a smaller portion being amorphous, would be consistent with the known properties of Lente Insulin.

Ovicidal agents are necessary in the treatment of scabies because they can kill the eggs (nits) of the scabies mite, preventing re-infestation.

A. BHC (Benzene Hexachloride) - Also known as Lindane, it is indeed an ovicidal agent and has been used in the past for treating scabies, but it's not the most preferred option due to its potential neurotoxicity and resistance.

B. DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) - This is a potent insecticide, but it's not typically used for scabies treatment due to its toxicity and environmental concerns.

C. HHC (HexaHydroCannabinol) - This is a cannabinoid, not typically associated with scabies treatment or as an ovicidal agent.

D. Permethrin - This is a topical cream rinse that is widely used and recommended for the treatment of scabies. It is effective against both the scabies mite and its eggs (ovicidal).

1570,Most cases of paraneoplastic syndrome are associated with which type of lung carcinoma?,"['Small Cell Ca', 'Bronchogenic Ca', 'Bronchoalveolar Ca', 'Adeno Ca']","To answer this question, let's consider the characteristics of each type of lung carcinoma mentioned.

Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare disorders that are triggered by an abnormal immune response to a tumor, but the symptoms are not due to direct local effects of the tumor cells. They can occur with various types of cancer, but some are more commonly associated with certain tumor types.

Small cell carcinoma (A) is a highly aggressive form of lung cancer that originates in the neuroendocrine cells of the lung. It is known to be associated with a wide range of paraneoplastic syndromes, including syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), Cushing's syndrome, and Eaton-Lambert syndrome, among others.

Bronchogenic carcinoma (B) is a broad term for lung cancer that originates in the bronchial tubes. While it encompasses all types of lung cancer, it's too nonspecific to be the best answer.

Bronchoalveolar carcinoma (C), also known as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) when part of the spectrum of adenocarcinoma, is a subtype of lung adenocarcinoma that grows in a lepidic pattern, along the alveolar structures. It's not as commonly associated with paraneoplastic syndromes as small cell carcinoma.

Adenocarcinoma (D), or Adeno Ca as it's abbreviated in the question, is the most common type of lung cancer in the United States and is known for its varying histological patterns. While it can be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, it is not the most commonly associated type.

Given these considerations, the type of lung carcinoma most commonly associated with paraneoplastic syndromes is small cell carcinoma.

Complete Transurethral resection with intravesical chemotherapy.

The reason for this choice is as follows:

- The cancer is confined to the trigone and has extended to the submucosa, which is a stage where surgical resection is feasible and effective. However, due to the extension to the submucosa, there is a risk of recurrence.

- Intravesical chemotherapy is a standard treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. It involves instilling chemotherapy into the bladder to kill any remaining cancer cells after the initial resection.

- Complete Transurethral resection (TUR) alone (option A) is not sufficient as a standalone treatment because it does not address the risk of recurrence.

- Palliative radiotherapy (option C) is generally reserved for patients with more advanced disease where curative surgery or chemotherapy is not feasible.

- Radical cystectomy (option D) is typically reserved for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stage T1b or higher) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in elderly patients.

A granuloma is a type of chronic inflammatory reaction that involves the immune system's attempt to wall off substances it recognizes as foreign but cannot eliminate. It typically consists of:

1. A chronic inflammatory infiltrate, which is a hallmark of granulomatous inflammation. This is characterized by the presence of various immune cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and sometimes eosinophils. So, option A is a characteristic feature of granuloma.

2. Epithelioid cells are derived from macrophages that have undergone transformation in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. They are a key component of granulomatous inflammation, so option B is also a characteristic feature.

3. Giant cells, specifically Langhans giant cells, are a type of multinucleated cell formed by the fusion of macrophages. They are a characteristic feature of granulomatous inflammation, making option C correct as well.

4. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) with fibrinoid necrosis and cellular infiltrates are more characteristic of acute inflammatory reactions and conditions like vasculitis, rather than granulomatous inflammation. While granulomas can have areas of necrosis, this description doesn't fit the typical presentation of a granuloma.

1587,What is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome,"['Reduced plasma protein', 'Sodium and water retention', 'Increased venous pressure', 'Hyperlipidemia']","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of nephrotic syndrome and edema:

1. **Nephrotic syndrome**: This is a collection of symptoms resulting from severe damage to the kidneys' glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. The damage leads to the excessive loss of protein in the urine, particularly albumin.

2. **Edema in nephrotic syndrome**: Edema is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome. The primary cause of edema in nephrotic syndrome is the loss of albumin, which is a type of protein found in blood plasma. Albumin plays a crucial role in maintaining blood volume by pulling fluid from the bloodstream into blood vessels. Without enough albumin, fluid leaks out of blood vessels and into the tissues, causing swelling or edema.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A. Reduced plasma protein**: This option directly addresses the cause of edema in nephrotic syndrome. The loss of albumin (a plasma protein) leads to decreased oncotic pressure in the blood vessels, causing fluid to leak out into the interstitial spaces, resulting in edema.

- **B. Sodium and water retention**: While sodium and water retention can cause edema, it's more characteristic of nephritic syndrome rather than nephrotic syndrome. In nephrotic syndrome, the primary issue is the loss of plasma proteins, not the retention of sodium and water.

- **C. Increased venous pressure**: This is not a direct cause of edema in nephrotic syndrome. Increased venous pressure would more typically cause peripheral edema due to venous obstruction or heart failure, rather than the specific type of edema seen in nephrotic syndrome.

- **D. Hyperlipidemia**: Hyperlipidemia is a common complication of nephrotic syndrome, resulting from the liver producing more lipids in response to the loss of albumin, but it is not the direct cause of edema.

Which of the following embryologic events is most likely responsible for the development of such conditions?,"['Faulty development of the sternum and pericardium, secondary to incomplete fusion of the lateral folds', 'Interruption of third pharyngeal arch development', 'Interruption of fourth pharyngeal arch development', 'Interruption of fifth pharyngeal arch development']","To approach this question, let's consider the embryological development of the thoracic cavity and the structures involved in ectopia cordis.

Ectopia cordis is a congenital heart defect where the heart is located outside the thoracic cavity, either partially or completely. This condition is often associated with other midline defects, such as cleft sternum or omphalocele.

During embryonic development, the thoracic cavity is formed by the fusion of the lateral folds, which eventually gives rise to the sternum and the pericardium. Incomplete fusion of these folds can lead to cleft sternum or other defects that may allow the heart to protrude outside the chest cavity.

Option A suggests faulty development of the sternum and pericardium, secondary to incomplete fusion of the lateral folds. This is the most plausible explanation for the development of ectopia cordis, as it directly relates to the formation of the thoracic cavity and the structures that support the heart.

Option B, C, and D involve the interruption of pharyngeal arch development, which is not directly related to the formation of the thoracic cavity or the location of the heart.

A. It is managed by stripping superficial saphenous venous system: This statement is true. Stripping of the superficial saphenous vein is a surgical procedure that can be performed to help manage venous ulcers by removing the incompetent vein and alleviating the pressure on the ulcer.

B. It may be associated with Klippel Trenaunay syndrome: This statement is also true. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that involves the development of varicose veins, limb hypertrophy, and skin changes, including venous ulcers. This association is a known complication of the syndrome.

C. It is found in elderly males: This statement is true as well. Venous ulcers are more common in the elderly population, and males are also more likely to be affected than females.

D. Biopsy is required for long standing ulcer: This statement is false. A biopsy is not typically required for the diagnosis of a venous ulcer. The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical presentation, including the location and characteristics of the ulcer, as well as the patient's medical history and physical examination. Other tests, such as venous Doppler studies, can also be used to assess venous function and rule out other causes of the ulcer.

The tendon(s) of which muscle will most likely be affected?,"['Flexor digitorum profundus', 'Flexor digitorum superficialis', 'Flexor pollicis longus', 'Flexor carpi radialis']","To determine which tendon will most likely be affected, we need to identify the muscle that innervates the tendon and is associated with the radial bursa.

The radial bursa is located around the extensor tendons, specifically around the extensor pollicis longus and brevis, and the extensor pollicis digitorum tendons. However, the question mentions the radial bursa and the spread of infection, which would likely affect the tendons in close proximity to the bursa.

The flexor pollicis longus tendon, which is responsible for flexion of the thumb, passes through the radial bursa. The flexor pollicis longus is innervated by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve and is associated with the radial bursa.

The flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis are both associated with the flexor digitorum tendon sheath, not the radial bursa. The flexor carpi radialis tendon is also not associated with the radial bursa.

- A. Lefort 1 fracture: This is a fracture of the lower maxilla and doesn't significantly alter the anatomy of the upper airway, making oronasal intubation still feasible.
- B. Lefort 2 and 3 fractures: These fractures involve the midface (Lefort 2) and the upper face (Lefort 3) and can compromise the airway. However, they do not inherently prevent oronasal intubation; in fact, securing the airway is a priority in managing these patients.
- C. Parietal bone fracture: This is a fracture of the bone forming the sides and roof of the cranium. Such fractures do not directly impact the airway, and oronasal intubation is still possible.
- D. Mandibular fracture: This involves the lower jaw and can significantly compromise the airway. However, the question is about oronasal intubation, which is a method that involves passing the endotracheal tube through the nose and into the trachea. In cases of mandibular fractures, especially those that are severe and significantly displace the jaw, oronasal intubation may be difficult or impossible due to the anatomical distortion and the potential for the tube to be misplaced. 

Given the options, mandibular fracture (D) is the condition where oronasal intubation is not indicated due to the difficulty in securing the airway properly.

Let's examine each option:

A. IV Labetalol - Labetalol is a mixed alpha and beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat hypertension in pregnancy, including in the setting of acute hypertension during labor. It's considered relatively safe for both the mother and the fetus.

B. IV Nitroprusside - Sodium nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that is effective in rapidly lowering blood pressure. However, it has a potential risk of cyanide toxicity, which is a concern in the setting of pregnancy, where the metabolism of nitroprusside can be altered, potentially leading to higher levels of cyanide. This makes it less favorable for use in acute hypertension during labor.

C. IV Hydralazine - Hydralazine is a vasodilator that is commonly used to treat acute hypertension in pregnancy. It's often the first-line treatment for acute hypertension in pregnant women, including those in labor, because it's effective and has a relatively safe profile for both the mother and the fetus.

D. IV Esmolol - Esmolol is a beta-blocker with a very short half-life, making it useful for acute management of hypertension. It's considered safe for use in pregnancy and labor, including for the treatment of acute hypertension.

A. Docusate: This is a stool softener that works by increasing the amount of water the stool absorbs, making it softer and easier to pass. It doesn't involve the opening of chloride channels.

B. Anthraquinone: This class of laxatives includes senna and aloe. They work by being absorbed into the intestinal wall and then being converted into active compounds that stimulate the muscles in the intestines to move stool along. Again, this doesn't involve the opening of chloride channels.

C. Lubiprostone: This laxative is known for its mechanism of action involving the opening of chloride channels (Cl-) in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. This action leads to an increase in the amount of water and chloride ions secreted into the intestinal lumen, which helps to soften the stool and increase the motility of the intestine.

D. Bisacodyl: Bisacodyl works by stimulating the muscles in the intestines to move stool along, but it doesn't involve the opening of chloride channels. It's more of a stimulant laxative.

Given the information, the correct answer is the one that matches the mechanism of action involving the opening of chloride channels.

1623,What is the most likely diagnosis in this 50-year-old woman?,"['Metastasis', 'Onychomycosis', 'Psoriasis', 'Thromboangiitis obliterans']","To determine the most likely diagnosis, I would need more information about the patient's symptoms and medical history. However, based on the options provided, I'll make an educated guess.

Assuming the patient has a lesion or condition affecting her nails, I would choose option B. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails, which is a common condition in middle-aged adults. It can present with thickened, discolored, or brittle nails.

The other options are less likely:
A. Metastasis refers to the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another. While it's a possibility, it's not directly related to nail symptoms unless the cancer is known to metastasize to the nails.
C. Psoriasis is a skin condition that can affect the nails, but it typically presents with pitting, redness, or thickening of the skin around the nails, rather than a primary nail infection.
D. Thromboangiitis obliterans is a rare disease that affects blood vessels, causing inflammation and blockage. While it can lead to various symptoms, nail changes are not a primary feature of this condition.

1624,Head of sperm is derived from:,"['Golgi Body.', 'Nucleus', 'Mitochondria.', 'Centromere']","To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the structure and function of a sperm cell.

A sperm cell, also known as a spermatozoon, consists of several distinct parts:

1. **Head**: This is the front part of the sperm cell and contains the genetic material (DNA) necessary for fertilization.
2. **Midpiece**: This is the middle section of the sperm cell, where the mitochondria are located. The mitochondria provide the energy for the sperm to move.
3. **Tail (flagellum)**: This is the long, thin tail that propels the sperm forward.

Given the options, we can deduce the following:

- **A. Golgi Body**: The Golgi apparatus is involved in processing and modifying proteins and lipids, but it's not specifically related to the head of the sperm.
- **B. Nucleus**: The nucleus of a cell, including the head of a sperm cell, contains the genetic material. Therefore, it makes sense that the head of the sperm is derived from the nucleus.
- **C. Mitochondria**: These are found in the midpiece of the sperm cell and are responsible for energy production, not the head.
- **D. Centromere**: A centromere is a part of a chromosome that helps to attach the chromosome to the spindle fibers during cell division. It's not directly related to the structure of a sperm cell.

Considering the function of each part, the correct answer is the one related to the nucleus, which contains the genetic material that would form the head of the sperm cell.

1625,Decreased motility of fallopian tube is seen in -,"['Churg- strauss syndrome', 'Kartagener s syndrome', 'Noonan syndrome', 'Turner syndrome']","To solve this question, let's examine the options in relation to the condition described, which is decreased motility of the fallopian tube.

A. Churg-Strauss syndrome is a condition characterized by vasculitis and is associated with asthma, eosinophilia, and other symptoms. It does not have a direct link with the motility of the fallopian tubes.

B. Kartagener's syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures found on the surface of cells, including those lining the respiratory tract and the fallopian tubes. This condition leads to impaired motility of the cilia, which can result in respiratory problems (like bronchiectasis) and reproductive issues, including decreased motility of the fallopian tubes.

C. Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects various parts of the body, including the heart, head, and skeleton. While it can affect the reproductive system, it is not primarily associated with decreased motility of the fallopian tubes.

D. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females, causing short stature and ovarian failure. It does not primarily affect the motility of the fallopian tubes.

Given this information, the correct answer is the condition that directly affects the cilia and can lead to decreased motility of the fallopian tubes.

1626,"All the following features favour ventricular tachycardia as the cause of broad-complex tachycardia, except -","['Fusion beats', 'Extreme left axis deviation', 'Very broad QRS complexes (> 140 ms)', 'Non response to carotid sinus massage']","To approach this question, let's evaluate each option in the context of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and broad-complex tachycardia:

A. **Fusion beats**: Fusion beats are characteristic of VT, where the ventricular rate is faster than the atrial rate, and there are beats that appear to be a combination of the two rates. This occurs when a ventricular beat is triggered by the atrial rhythm, and the ventricles are already being paced by the VT. Fusion beats are a strong indication of VT.

B. **Extreme left axis deviation**: In broad-complex tachycardia, left axis deviation (LAD) can sometimes be a clue towards VT, but it's not a definitive indicator. VT can have a left axis deviation, especially if there is significant left ventricular hypertrophy. However, it's not exclusive to VT, and other conditions can also present with LAD in this context.

C. **Very broad QRS complexes (> 140 ms)**: The presence of very broad QRS complexes is more suggestive of ventricular fibrillation or a supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy rather than VT. Typically, VT complexes have a narrower QRS duration than 140 ms, especially if it's a monomorphic VT.

D. **Non response to carotid sinus massage**: Nonresponse to carotid sinus massage (CSM) is a feature that can indicate VT. CSM is more likely to terminate a supraventricular tachycardia, especially if it's due to AV nodal reentrant tachycardia or AV reentrant tachycardia. VT is less likely to be affected by CSM.

Given the above analysis, the feature that least favours ventricular tachycardia as the cause of broad-complex tachycardia is **C. Very broad QRS complexes (> 140 ms)**, as this is more indicative of ventricular fibrillation or aberrancy in a supraventricular tachycardia rather than VT.

Among the options provided, let's evaluate each one:

A. Argon (Ar) - Argon is a noble gas that makes up about 0.93% to 1.00% of the Earth's atmosphere. It is the third most abundant gas after nitrogen and oxygen.

B. Carbon dioxide (CO2) - Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that makes up a relatively small fraction of the atmosphere, approximately 0.04%. This is much less than the abundance of argon.

C. Hydrogen (H2) - Hydrogen is a highly reactive gas that is not typically found in large quantities in the Earth's atmosphere. While it is a major component of other compounds like water (H2O) and organic molecules, it is not a significant component of the atmosphere.

D. Methane (CH4) - Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that makes up a very small fraction of the atmosphere, approximately 0.0002% to 2.0 ppm.

1630,Healing of a wound which simply restores the continuity of the diseased marginal gingiva is known as,"['Regeneration', 'new attachment', 'Repair', 'reattachment']","The correct answer is C. Repair.

Healing of a wound through repair involves the formation of granulation tissue and the laying down of a scar, restoring the continuity of the tissue. In the case of the marginal gingiva, this would simply restore the continuity of the diseased tissue without any regeneration or reattachment of lost periodontal attachment.

Regeneration (A) would involve the growth of new tissue, including periodontal ligament and bone, to restore the original architecture.

New attachment (B) would involve the growth of new periodontal ligament and bone to reattach the tooth to the surrounding bone.

1632,Lactic acid is produced in mouth by,"['Saccharolytic bacteria in supragingival region', 'Saccharolytic bacteria in subgingival region', 'Non-saccharolytic bacteria in supragingival region', 'Non-saccharolytic bacteria in subgingival region']","To answer this question, let's break down the options and the process involved.

Lactic acid is a byproduct of the fermentation of sugars by bacteria in the oral cavity. The production of lactic acid is a key factor in the development of dental caries (tooth decay).

Saccharolytic bacteria are those that break down sugars, which is the primary source of energy for them. These bacteria can produce lactic acid as a byproduct of their metabolic activity.

The subgingival region refers to the area below the gum line, whereas the supragingival region refers to the area above the gum line.

Non-saccharolytic bacteria, on the other hand, do not break down sugars as their primary source of energy. They may obtain their energy from other sources, such as amino acids or other compounds.

Given these details, we can now analyze the options:

A. Saccharolytic bacteria in supragingival region: This option suggests that saccharolytic bacteria (those that break down sugars) are producing lactic acid in the supragingival region. This is a plausible scenario, as saccharolytic bacteria can indeed produce lactic acid in the presence of sugars.

B. Saccharolytic bacteria in subgingival region: This option also suggests that saccharolytic bacteria are producing lactic acid, but in the subgingival region. However, the subgingival region is generally not as exposed to sugars as the supragingival region, making this option less likely.

C. Non-saccharolytic bacteria in supragingival region: This option suggests that non-saccharolytic bacteria (those that do not break down sugars) are producing lactic acid in the supragingival region. This is unlikely, as non-saccharolytic bacteria do not rely on sugars as their primary source of energy.

D. Non-saccharolytic bacteria in subgingival region: This option suggests that non-saccharolytic bacteria are producing lactic acid in the subgingival region. This is also unlikely, for the same reason as option C.

Based on this analysis, the most likely scenario is that saccharolytic bacteria are producing lactic acid in the supragingival region.

1634,Leukoplakia appears white due to :,"['Cornified layer which imbibes water.', 'Thick epithelium', 'Underlying connective tissue', 'All of the above']","To answer this question, let's break down the options and consider what leukoplakia is. Leukoplakia is a condition characterized by the formation of white patches or plaques on mucous membranes, often in the mouth. These patches are typically benign but can be precancerous in some cases.

Option A suggests that the cornified layer, which is the outermost layer of the epithelium, imbibes water, making it white. This makes sense because the cornified layer can indeed become hydrated, leading to a whitish appearance. This is a plausible explanation for the white coloration seen in leukoplakia.

Option B mentions thick epithelium. While it's true that the epithelium in leukoplakia can become thickened, this isn't directly related to the white appearance.

Option C refers to the underlying connective tissue. Changes in the underlying tissue might contribute to the formation of leukoplakia, but they wouldn't typically cause the white coloration.

Option D, ""All of the above,"" is incorrect because not all these options directly contribute to the white appearance of leukoplakia.

Given these considerations, the most likely explanation for the white appearance of leukoplakia is related to the hydration of the cornified layer, as described in option A.

1636,At what level of b-hCG is it that normal pregnancy can be earliest detected by TVS (transvaginal USG)?,"['500 IU/mL', '1000 IU/mL', '1500 IU/mL', '2000 IU/mL']","To determine the correct answer, let's consider the role of b-hCG (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) in pregnancy and its relationship with transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) detection.

b-hCG is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. Its levels increase rapidly in the early stages of pregnancy, and it is often used as an indicator of pregnancy. The level of b-hCG can be measured in the blood to confirm pregnancy and can also help determine the gestational age of the fetus.

Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is a technique used to visualize the uterus and its contents, including the embryo or fetus. It is more sensitive than transabdominal ultrasound, allowing for earlier detection of pregnancy.

The earliest detection of a normal pregnancy by TVS is typically possible when b-hCG levels are sufficient to support the visualization of an embryo or fetus, but not so high that it complicates the measurement of gestational age or increases the risk of false positives.

Given the above, the level of b-hCG at which normal pregnancy can be earliest detected by TVS is generally accepted to be around 1000-1500 IU/mL. This allows for the detection of a gestational sac within the uterine cavity, which is an early indicator of pregnancy.

Considering the options provided:

A. 500 IU/mL - This level of b-hCG may not be sufficient for TVS detection of a normal pregnancy.
B. 1000 IU/mL - This is a commonly cited threshold for the earliest detection of a normal pregnancy by TVS.
C. 1500 IU/mL - While detection may be possible at this level, it is generally considered lower than necessary for the earliest detection.
D. 2000 IU/mL - This level of b-hCG would likely be higher than necessary for the earliest detection of a normal pregnancy.

Chronic Cor pulmonale is a condition where the right side of the heart is enlarged and weakened due to chronic pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Now, let's analyze each option:

A. Kerley B lines: These are short, horizontal lines at the lung periphery, seen on chest X-rays in cases of pulmonary edema. They are often seen in conditions that cause fluid overload or increased pulmonary capillary pressure, such as heart failure. However, they are not a specific feature of Chronic Cor pulmonale. 

B. Prominent lower lobe vessels: In Chronic Cor pulmonale, there is often increased blood flow and congestion in the lungs, which can lead to prominent pulmonary vessels, particularly in the lower lobes. This option is consistent with the condition.

C. Pleural effusion: Pleural effusion can occur in Chronic Cor pulmonale due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary veins, leading to fluid accumulation in the pleural space. This option is also consistent with the condition.

D. Cardiomegaly: Cardiomegaly (enlargement of the heart) is a hallmark of Chronic Cor pulmonale, as the right ventricle is often hypertrophied and enlarged in response to increased pressure and volume overload. This option is consistent with the condition.

Given this analysis, option A (Kerley B lines) is the least specific feature of Chronic Cor pulmonale, as they can be seen in a variety of conditions that cause pulmonary edema, not just Cor pulmonale.

A. Brain Natriuretic peptide analogue: This option seems plausible as Nestritide is indeed related to natriuretic peptides. The medication is likely an analogue or mimic of the naturally occurring brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance.

B. Endothelin R antagonist: Endothelin receptor antagonists are a class of medications that block the action of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor. While this is an important class of medications, there is no clear connection between endothelin antagonists and the name ""Nestritide"".

C. Gp Ilb/IIIa antagonist: Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists are antiplatelet medications that inhibit platelet aggregation. This class of medications is used to prevent thrombotic complications in patients undergoing angioplasty or experiencing acute coronary syndromes. There is no apparent connection between this class and the name ""Nestritide"".

D. INF-a antagonist: Interferon-alpha (INF-a) antagonists are medications that block the action of interferon-alpha, which is involved in the immune response. This class of medications is used in the treatment of certain viral infections and cancers. There is no clear connection between INF-a antagonists and the name ""Nestritide"".

A. Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal, sphere-shaped red blood cells that are prone to premature destruction, but it typically involves extravascular hemolysis, not intravascular hemolysis.

B. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a condition where the immune system produces antibodies against the patient's own red blood cells, marking them for destruction. This process usually occurs in the spleen, which is an extravascular site.

C. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, bone marrow failure, and the potential for blood clot formation. PNH is associated with intravascular hemolysis, where red blood cells are destroyed within the bloodstream.

D. Thalassemia is a group of genetic disorders that affect the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.

Coenzyme A is a crucial coenzyme involved in various biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids, and the decarboxylation of pyruvate in the citric acid cycle. It is composed of several components, including pantothenic acid, a thiol group, and an adenine nucleotide.

Pantothenic acid is a vitamin (Vitamin B5) that serves as a precursor for CoA. However, it is not the active moiety itself.

A. Transient, recurrent episodes of visual loss: This is a characteristic feature of amaurosis fugax, which is a temporary loss of vision in one eye due to a lack of blood flow to the retina. So, this statement is true.

B. Binocular lesion: Amaurosis fugax typically affects one eye at a time, and the lesion is unilateral, not binocular. Binocular lesions would imply a problem that affects both eyes simultaneously. Therefore, this option seems to be the one that does not fit with the typical presentation of amaurosis fugax.

C. Embolus from carotid artery is commonest cause: Amaurosis fugax is often caused by emboli from the carotid arteries, which can temporarily block the flow of blood to the retina. This is indeed a common cause of the condition. So, this statement is true.

D. Ocular examination may be normal: During an episode of amaurosis fugax, the retina may appear normal during an ocular examination because the problem is transient and due to reduced blood flow. Therefore, this statement is true.

Given the analysis, the correct answer is the option that does not fit with the typical characteristics of amaurosis fugax.
