1,"Following endaerectomy on the right common carotid, a patient is found to be blind in the right eye. It is appears that a small thrombus embolized during surgery and lodged in the aery supplying the optic nerve. Which aery would be blocked?","['Central aery of the retina', 'Infraorbital aery', 'Lacrimal aery', 'Nasociliary aretry']","To determine which artery would be blocked, we need to consider the blood supply to the eye, particularly the optic nerve. The central artery of the retina is responsible for supplying oxygenated blood to the retina and the optic nerve. This artery is a direct continuation of the ophthalmic artery, which in turn is a branch of the internal carotid artery. Given that a small thrombus embolized during surgery and lodged in the artery supplying the optic nerve, it is most likely that the central artery of the retina was blocked, leading to blindness in the right eye.

2,Per rectum examination is not a useful test for diagnosis of,"['Anal fissure', 'Hemorrhoid', 'Pilonidal sinus', 'Rectal ulcer']","A per rectum (PR) examination involves a healthcare provider inserting a gloved finger into the rectum to feel for abnormalities. This can be useful for diagnosing conditions such as hemorrhoids (B), rectal ulcers (D), and even pilonidal sinus (C), as the healthcare provider can feel for masses or abnormalities.

However, an anal fissure (A) is typically diagnosed through other means, such as visual examination, patient history, and sometimes with the use of an anoscope. A PR examination may not be as useful for diagnosing an anal fissure, as it is primarily a symptom-based diagnosis, and the PR exam may not provide enough information to confirm the presence of a fissure.

3,Chronic urethral obstruction due to benign prismatic hyperplasia can lead to the following change in kidney parenchyma,"['Hyperplasia', 'Hyperophy', 'Atrophy', 'Dyplasia']","To answer this question, we need to consider the effects of chronic urethral obstruction on the kidneys, particularly in the context of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Chronic urethral obstruction due to BPH leads to increased pressure in the urinary tract, which can cause backflow of urine into the kidneys. This backflow, also known as vesicoureteral reflux, can cause damage to the kidneys over time. Specifically, it can lead to a decrease in the size and function of the kidney tissue, resulting in a change in the kidney parenchyma.

The correct term to describe this change is ""atrophy,"" which refers to the shrinkage or wasting of tissue, in this case, the kidney parenchyma.

6,Growth hormone has its effect on growth through?,"['Directly', 'IG1-1', 'Thyroxine', 'Intranuclear receptors']","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options in relation to how growth hormone (GH) affects growth.

A. Directly: GH does not have a direct effect on growth. It stimulates the production of other hormones and growth factors that ultimately lead to growth.

B. IG1-1: GH stimulates the liver and other tissues to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), also known as somatomedin C. IGF-1 is a key mediator of the growth-promoting effects of GH, making this a strong candidate.

C. Thyroxine: Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland and is involved in regulating metabolism. While the thyroid hormone can influence growth indirectly, it is not the primary mechanism through which GH exerts its effects on growth.

D. Intranuclear receptors: GH exerts its effects by binding to GH receptors on the surface of cells, not through intranuclear receptors. This option does not accurately describe the mechanism of GH action.

Considering the above information, the correct answer is B. IG1-1, as GH stimulates the production of IGF-1, which in turn promotes growth.

9,All of the following are surgical options for morbid obesity except -,"['Adjustable gastric banding', 'Biliopancreatic diversion', 'Duodenal Switch', 'Roux en Y Duodenal By pass']","To answer this question, let's evaluate each option in the context of surgical options for morbid obesity:

A. Adjustable gastric banding: This is a common and well-established surgical procedure for morbid obesity. It involves placing an adjustable band around the upper part of the stomach to create a small pouch, limiting food intake.

B. Biliopancreatic diversion: This is indeed another surgical option for morbid obesity, although it's a more complex procedure. It involves removing a portion of the stomach and rerouting the small intestine to limit nutrient absorption.

C. Duodenal Switch: Similar to the biliopancreatic diversion, the duodenal switch is a more complex surgical procedure that involves removing a portion of the stomach and rerouting the small intestine to reduce food intake and nutrient absorption.

D. Roux en Y Duodenal By pass: This is actually a less common surgical procedure for morbid obesity. It primarily involves bypassing a portion of the small intestine rather than altering the stomach. It's less commonly performed compared to the other options listed, which directly alter the stomach and involve more substantial changes to the digestive system.

Given the context of commonly performed surgical procedures for morbid obesity, Roux en Y Duodenal By pass stands out as the less typical option.

17,True regarding lag phase is?,"['Time taken to adpt in the new environment', 'Growth occurs exponentially', 'The plateau in lag phase is due to cell death', 'It is the 2nd phase in bacterial growth curve']","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the characteristics of the lag phase in a bacterial growth curve:

1. **Adaptation**: During the lag phase, the bacteria are adapting to their new environment. This includes adjusting to the new nutrient availability, temperature, pH, and other conditions. Therefore, option A, ""Time taken to adapt in the new environment,"" is correct.

2. **Growth Pattern**: In the lag phase, the bacteria are preparing for growth by synthesizing proteins and other molecules necessary for rapid multiplication. However, there is no exponential growth during this phase; that occurs in the log phase. So, option B, ""Growth occurs exponentially,"" is incorrect because exponential growth happens after the lag phase.

3. **Cell Death**: The plateau or stationary phase of the bacterial growth curve is characterized by a balance between the rate of cell division and the rate of cell death, not the lag phase. In the lag phase, there is no significant cell death, as the cells are primarily preparing to grow. Thus, option C, ""The plateau in lag phase is due to cell death,"" is incorrect.

4. **Phase in Bacterial Growth Curve**: The lag phase is indeed the initial phase of the bacterial growth curve, occurring before the exponential or log phase. However, the question specifically asks which option is ""True regarding lag phase,"" and the focus is on what happens during this phase, making option A a more accurate description of the lag phase.

18,Superior vena cava is derived from:,"['Aortic arch', 'Pharyngeal arch', 'Cardinal vein', 'Vitelline vein']","To determine the correct answer, let's review the embryological development of the venous system.

The superior vena cava (SVC) is a major vein that returns deoxygenated blood from the upper body to the heart. During embryological development, it is formed from the anterior cardinal veins.

The anterior cardinal veins are a pair of large, symmetrical veins that drain blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs. They eventually merge to form the superior vena cava.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. Aortic arch - The aortic arch is part of the arterial system, not the venous system, and is not directly related to the formation of the SVC.

B. Pharyngeal arch - The pharyngeal arches are structures that form during embryological development and give rise to various structures in the head and neck, including the cranial nerves and muscles of the face. They are not directly related to the formation of the SVC.

C. Cardinal vein - The anterior cardinal veins are indeed the precursors to the superior vena cava. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

D. Vitelline vein - The vitelline veins are part of the venous system that drains blood from the yolk sac and are involved in the formation of the inferior vena cava, not the superior vena cava.

The final answer is C.",C,0.8928920580817605,C,True
19,Hyper viscosity is seen in,"['Cryoglobulinemia', 'Multiple myeloma', 'MGUS', 'Lymphoma']","To answer this question, let's analyze each option in relation to the condition of hyper viscosity, which refers to an abnormally high blood viscosity, or thickness, that can lead to various complications, including decreased blood flow and potentially organ damage.

A. Cryoglobulinemia: This is a condition where abnormal proteins called cryoglobulins are present in the blood and can precipitate at low temperatures, leading to blood vessel inflammation and damage. Hyper viscosity can be a symptom of cryoglobulinemia due to the abnormal proteins causing the blood to thicken.

B. Multiple myeloma: This is a type of blood cancer characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. While multiple myeloma can lead to various complications, such as anemia, infections, and bone damage, it's less commonly directly associated with hyper viscosity, which is more typically seen in conditions where there is a significant increase in the concentration of large molecules or cells in the blood, such as in plasma cell dyscrasias.

C. MGUS (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance): MGUS is a condition where there's an abnormal protein (monoclonal protein or M-protein) present in the blood but without any signs of multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders. While MGUS is related to plasma cell dyscrasias and can involve monoclonal proteins, it is less likely to cause significant hyper viscosity compared to conditions like multiple myeloma or WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia.

D. Lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that begins in cells of the lymph system (part of the immune system). While lymphoma can lead to various systemic complications, including weight loss, fever, and fatigue, it is not commonly associated with hyper viscosity as a direct result of the disease process.

Considering the options, cryoglobulinemia (A) is the condition most directly associated with hyper viscosity due to the presence of abnormal proteins that can cause the blood to thicken.
